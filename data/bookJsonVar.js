The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,\u2014a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.\r\n\r\nAs Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, \u201cLet me see the child, and die.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed\u2019s head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you must not talk about dying yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLor bless her dear heart, no!\u201d interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cLor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on \u2019em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she\u2019ll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there\u2019s a dear young lamb do.\u201d\r\n\r\nApparently this consolatory perspective of a mother\u2019s prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back\u2014and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!\u201d said the surgeon at last.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, poor dear, so it is!\u201d said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child. \u201cPoor dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,\u201d said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely it will be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.\u201d He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door, added, \u201cShe was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was brought here last night,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cby the overseer\u2019s order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. \u201cThe old story,\u201d he said, shaking his head: \u201cno wedding-ring, I see. Ah! Good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.\r\n\r\nWhat an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once\u2014a parish child\u2014the orphan of a workhouse\u2014the humble, half-starved drudge\u2014to be cuffed and buffeted through the world\u2014despised by all, and pitied by none.\r\n\r\nOliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTREATS OF OLIVER TWIST\u2019S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD\r\n\r\nFor the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in \u201cthe house\u201d who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be \u201cfarmed,\u201d or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny\u2019s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of her system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing\u2014though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm\u2014the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to behold, when they went; and what more would the people have!\r\n\r\nIt cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist\u2019s ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver\u2019s breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?\u201d said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy. \u201c(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash \u2019em directly.)\u2014My heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201cLor, only think,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, running out,\u2014for the three boys had been removed by this time,\u2014\u201conly think of that! That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, \u201cto keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann with great humility.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance. He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He relaxed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, Mrs. Mann,\u201d he replied in a calmer tone; \u201cit may be as you say; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t you be offended at what I\u2019m a going to say,\u201d observed Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn\u2019t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr. Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a drop. Nor a drop,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a dignified, but placid manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you will,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. \u201cJust a leetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble coughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, just a leetle drop,\u201d said Mrs. Mann persuasively.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d inquired the beadle.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s what I\u2019m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants\u2019 Daffy, when they ain\u2019t well, Mr. Bumble,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. \u201cIt\u2019s gin. I\u2019ll not deceive you, Mr. B. It\u2019s gin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?\u201d inquired Bumble, following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, bless \u2019em, that I do, dear as it is,\u201d replied the nurse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see \u2019em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u201d; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; \u201cno, you could not. You are a humane woman, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (Here she set down the glass.) \u201cI shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (He drew it towards him.) \u201cYou feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (He stirred the gin-and-water.) \u201cI\u2014I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann\u201d; and he swallowed half of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now about business,\u201d said the beadle, taking out a leathern pocket-book. \u201cThe child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year old to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBless him!\u201d interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat\u2019ral exertions on the part of this parish,\u201d said Bumble, \u201cwe have never been able to discover who is his father, or what was his mother\u2019s settlement, name, or condition.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment\u2019s reflection, \u201cHow comes he to have any name at all, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, \u201cI inwented it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou, Mr. Bumble!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last was a S,\u2014Swubble, I named him. This was a T,\u2014Twist, I named him. The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when we come to Z.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re quite a literary character, sir!\u201d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment; \u201cperhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.\u201d He finished the gin-and-water, and added, \u201cOliver being now too old to remain here, the board have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out myself to take him there. So let me see him at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll fetch him directly,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that purpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.\r\n\r\n\u201cMake a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,\u201d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\nOliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and the cocked hat on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you go along with me, Oliver?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic voice.\r\n\r\nOliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had got behind the beadle\u2019s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance. He took the hint at once, for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill she go with me?\u201d inquired poor Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she can\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cBut she\u2019ll come and see you sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was, however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away. It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes. Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years. And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him. Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child\u2019s heart for the first time.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were \u201cnearly there.\u201d To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.\r\n\r\nOliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.\r\n\r\nNot having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face.\r\n\r\n\u201cBow to the board,\u201d said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d said the gentleman in the high chair.\r\n\r\nOliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry. These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool. Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoy,\u201d said the gentleman in the high chair, \u201clisten to me. You know you\u2019re an orphan, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, sir?\u201d inquired poor Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy is a fool\u2014I thought he was,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said the gentleman who had spoken first. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What could the boy be crying for?\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you say your prayers every night,\u201d said another gentleman in a gruff voice; \u201cand pray for the people who feed you, and take care of you\u2014like a Christian.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him. But he hadn\u2019t, because nobody had taught him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,\u201d said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o\u2019clock,\u201d added the surly one in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\nFor the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England! They let the paupers go to sleep!\r\n\r\nPoor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it:\r\n\r\nThe members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered\u2014the poor people liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. \u201cOho!\u201d said the board, looking very knowing; \u201cwe are the fellows to set this to rights; we\u2019ll stop it all, in no time.\u201d So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it. With this view, they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays. They made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors\u2019 Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a bachelor! There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty. The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people.\r\n\r\nFor the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation. It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker\u2019s bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two\u2019s gruel. But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.\r\n\r\nThe room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes. Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more\u2014except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides.\r\n\r\nThe bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally excellent appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn\u2019t been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed him. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist.\r\n\r\nThe evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master, in his cook\u2019s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long grace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery. He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, sir, I want some more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said the master at length, in a faint voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, \u201cI want some more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe master aimed a blow at Oliver\u2019s head with the ladle; pinioned him in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.\r\n\r\nThe board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said,\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for more!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor more!\u201d said Mr. Limbkins. \u201cCompose yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe did, sir,\u201d replied Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat boy will be hung,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cI know that boy will be hung.\u201d\r\n\r\nNobody controverted the prophetic gentleman\u2019s opinion. An animated discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish. In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never was more convinced of anything in my life,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning: \u201cI never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be hung.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nRELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE\r\n\r\nFor a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual\u2019s prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver\u2019s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed by the enemies of \u201cthe system,\u201d that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane. As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example. And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one morning, while Oliver\u2019s affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing. Mr. Gamfield\u2019s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.\r\n\r\n\u201cWo\u2014o!\u201d said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.\r\n\r\nThe donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey\u2019s. Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back again. Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room. Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves. So, he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to \u2019prentis,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, my man,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile. \u201cWhat of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good \u2019spectable chimbley-sweepin\u2019 bisness,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, \u201cI wants a \u2019prentis, and I am ready to take him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWalk in,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nasty trade,\u201d said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated his wish.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,\u201d said another gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make \u2019em come down again,\u201d said Gamfield; \u201cthat\u2019s all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain\u2019t o\u2019 no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that\u2019s wot he likes. Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen\u2019l\u2019men, and there\u2019s nothink like a good hot blaze to make \u2019em come down vith a run. It\u2019s humane too, gen\u2019l\u2019men, acause, even if they\u2019ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes \u2019em struggle to hextricate theirselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins. The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words \u201csaving of expenditure,\u201d \u201clooked well in the accounts,\u201d \u201chave a printed report published,\u201d were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.\r\n\r\nAt length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have considered your proposition, and we don\u2019t approve of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cDecidedly not,\u201d added the other members.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t let me have him, gen\u2019l\u2019men?\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, pausing near the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mr. Limbkins; \u201cat least, as it\u2019s a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield\u2019s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned to the table, and said,\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you give, gen\u2019l\u2019men? Come! Don\u2019t be too hard on a poor man. What\u2019ll you give?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say, three pound ten was plenty,\u201d said Mr. Limbkins.\r\n\r\n\u201cTen shillings too much,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d said Gamfield; \u201csay four pound, gen\u2019l\u2019men. Say four pound, and you\u2019ve got rid of him for good and all. There!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThree pound ten,\u201d repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome! I\u2019ll split the diff\u2019erence, gen\u2019l\u2019men,\u201d urged Gamfield. \u201cThree pound fifteen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a farthing more,\u201d was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re desperate hard upon me, gen\u2019l\u2019men,\u201d said Gamfield, wavering.\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh! pooh! nonsense!\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cHe\u2019d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly fellow! He\u2019s just the boy for you. He wants the stick, now and then: it\u2019ll do him good; and his board needn\u2019t come very expensive, for he hasn\u2019t been overfed since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself. The bargain was made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that very afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. \u201cYou\u2019re a going to be made a \u2019prentice of, Oliver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA prentice, sir!\u201d said the child, trembling.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Oliver,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThe kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are a going to \u201cprentice\u201d you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!\u2014three pound ten, Oliver!\u2014seventy shillins\u2014one hundred and forty sixpences!\u2014and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can\u2019t love.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child\u2019s face, and he sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced; \u201cCome, Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don\u2019t cry into your gruel; that\u2019s a very foolish action, Oliver.\u201d It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.\r\n\r\nOn their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch him.\r\n\r\nThere the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned with the cocked hat, and said aloud:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.\u201d As Mr. Bumble said this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, \u201cMind what I told you, you young rascal!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble\u2019s face at this somewhat contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great window. Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were lounging about.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the boy, your worship,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, is this the boy?\u201d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is him, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cBow to the magistrate, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates\u2019 powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the old gentleman, \u201cI suppose he\u2019s fond of chimney-sweeping?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe doats on it, your worship,\u201d replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he will be a sweep, will he?\u201d inquired the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he\u2019d run away simultaneous, your worship,\u201d replied Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this man that\u2019s to be his master\u2014you, sir\u2014you\u2019ll treat him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?\u201d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I says I will, I means I will,\u201d replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open-hearted man,\u201d said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver\u2019s premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn\u2019t reasonably be expected to discern what other people did.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope I am, sir,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt you are, my friend,\u201d replied the old gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the inkstand.\r\n\r\nIt was the critical moment of Oliver\u2019s fate. If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off. But, as it chanced to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy boy!\u201d said the old gentleman, \u201cyou look pale and alarmed. What is the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStand a little away from him, Beadle,\u201d said the other magistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest. \u201cNow, boy, tell us what\u2019s the matter: don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that they would order him back to the dark room\u2014that they would starve him\u2014beat him\u2014kill him if they pleased\u2014rather than send him away with that dreadful man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity. \u201cWell! of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, Beadle,\u201d said the second old gentleman, when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your worship\u2019s pardon,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having heard aright. \u201cDid your worship speak to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Hold your tongue.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold his tongue! A moral revolution!\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his companion, he nodded significantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe refuse to sanction these indentures,\u201d said the old gentleman: tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope,\u201d stammered Mr. Limbkins: \u201cI hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter,\u201d said the second old gentleman sharply. \u201cTake the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nOLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE\r\n\r\nIn great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea. The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port. This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class. The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity. His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by the hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d said the beadle, as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. \u201cI say you\u2019ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d repeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his cane.\r\n\r\n\u201cThink so?\u201d said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event. \u201cThe prices allowed by the board are very small, Mr. Bumble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo are the coffins,\u201d replied the beadle: with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation. \u201cWell, well, Mr. Bumble,\u201d he said at length, \u201cthere\u2019s no denying that, since the new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble. Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cevery trade has its drawbacks. A fair profit is, of course, allowable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied the undertaker; \u201cand if I don\u2019t get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the long-run, you see\u2014he! he! he!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust so,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cThough I must say,\u201d continued the undertaker, resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted: \u201cthough I must say, Mr. Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four inches over one\u2019s calculation makes a great hole in one\u2019s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the bye,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cyou don\u2019t know anybody who wants a boy, do you? A porochial \u2019prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?\u201d As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words \u201cfive pounds\u201d: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size.\r\n\r\n\u201cGadso!\u201d said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged lappel of his official coat; \u201cthat\u2019s just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about. You know\u2014dear me, what a very elegant button this is, Mr. Bumble! I never noticed it before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I think it rather pretty,\u201d said the beadle, glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. \u201cThe die is the same as the porochial seal\u2014the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear\u2019s morning, Mr. Sowerberry. I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI recollect,\u201d said the undertaker. \u201cThe jury brought it in, \u2018Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,\u2019 didn\u2019t they?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they made it a special verdict, I think,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cby adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTush! Foolery!\u201d interposed the beadle. \u201cIf the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they\u2019d have enough to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery true,\u201d said the undertaker; \u201cthey would indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJuries,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont when working into a passion: \u201cjuries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling wretches.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo they are,\u201d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t no more philosophy nor political economy about \u2019em than that,\u201d said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more they have,\u201d acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cI despise \u2019em,\u201d said the beadle, growing very red in the face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d rejoined the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I only wish we\u2019d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for a week or two,\u201d said the beadle; \u201cthe rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet \u2019em alone for that,\u201d replied the undertaker. So saying, he smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.\r\n\r\nMr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell; what about the boy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d replied the undertaker; \u201cwhy, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good deal towards the poor\u2019s rates.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHem!\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d replied the undertaker, \u201cI was thinking that if I pay so much towards \u2019em, I\u2019ve a right to get as much out of \u2019em as I can, Mr. Bumble; and so\u2014I think I\u2019ll take the boy myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the building. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening \u201cupon liking\u201d\u2014a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to do what he likes with.\r\n\r\nWhen little Oliver was taken before \u201cthe gentlemen\u201d that evening; and informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a coffin-maker\u2019s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.\r\n\r\nNow, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance. The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his luggage put into his hand\u2014which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep\u2014he pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble\u2019s coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.\r\n\r\nFor some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble\u2019s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. As they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver!\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cPull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another. The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one. Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble\u2019s he covered his face with both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity. \u201cWell! Of all the ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, sir,\u201d sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the well-known cane; \u201cno, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I will, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so\u2014so\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo what?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo lonely, sir! So very lonely!\u201d cried the child. \u201cEverybody hates me. Oh! sir, don\u2019t, don\u2019t pray be cross to me!\u201d The child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion\u2019s face, with tears of real agony.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble regarded Oliver\u2019s piteous and helpless look, with some astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner; and after muttering something about \u201cthat troublesome cough,\u201d bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence.\r\n\r\nThe undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the middle of a word; \u201cis that you, Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one else, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cHere! I\u2019ve brought the boy.\u201d Oliver made a bow.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! that\u2019s the boy, is it?\u201d said the undertaker: raising the candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. \u201cMrs. Sowerberry, will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented the form of a short, thin, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, \u201cthis is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.\u201d Oliver bowed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d said the undertaker\u2019s wife, \u201che\u2019s very small.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he is rather small,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger; \u201che is small. There\u2019s no denying it. But he\u2019ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry\u2014he\u2019ll grow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I dare say he will,\u201d replied the lady pettishly, \u201con our victuals and our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they always cost more to keep, than they\u2019re worth. However, men always think they know best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o\u2019 bones.\u201d With this, the undertaker\u2019s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated \u201ckitchen\u201d; wherein sat a slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, Charlotte,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down, \u201cgive this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He hasn\u2019t come home since the morning, so he may go without \u2019em. I dare say the boy isn\u2019t too dainty to eat \u2019em\u2014are you, boy?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.\r\n\r\nI wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected. I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the undertaker\u2019s wife, when Oliver had finished his supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of his future appetite: \u201chave you done?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen come with me,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp, and leading the way upstairs; \u201cyour bed\u2019s under the counter. You don\u2019t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn\u2019t much matter whether you do or don\u2019t, for you can\u2019t sleep anywhere else. Come; don\u2019t keep me here all night!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nOLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER\u2019S BUSINESS\r\n\r\nOliver, being left to himself in the undertaker\u2019s shop, set the lamp down on a workman\u2019s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror. Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets. Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave.\r\n\r\nNor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.\r\n\r\nBut his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.\r\n\r\nOliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times. When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen the door, will yer?\u201d cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, directly, sir,\u201d replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning the key.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose yer the new boy, ain\u2019t yer?\u201d said the voice through the key-hole.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow old are yer?\u201d inquired the voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cTen, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll whop yer when I get in,\u201d said the voice; \u201cyou just see if I don\u2019t, that\u2019s all, my work\u2019us brat!\u201d and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle.\r\n\r\nOliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d said Oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his appearance; \u201cdid you knock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI kicked,\u201d replied the charity-boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you want a coffin, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver, innocently.\r\n\r\nAt this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYer don\u2019t know who I am, I suppose, Work\u2019us?\u201d said the charity-boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d rejoined Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Mister Noah Claypole,\u201d said the charity-boy, \u201cand you\u2019re under me. Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!\u201d With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great credit. It is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.\r\n\r\nOliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that \u201che\u2019d catch it,\u201d condescended to help him. Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared. Oliver having \u201ccaught it,\u201d in fulfilment of Noah\u2019s prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome near the fire, Noah,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cI saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master\u2019s breakfast. Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah\u2019s back, and take them bits that I\u2019ve put out on the cover of the bread-pan. There\u2019s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for they\u2019ll want you to mind the shop. D\u2019ye hear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019ye hear, Work\u2019us?\u201d said Noah Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cLor, Noah!\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cwhat a rum creature you are! Why don\u2019t you let the boy alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet him alone!\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhy everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty well. Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you queer soul!\u201d said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him.\r\n\r\nNoah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance-child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of \u201cleathers,\u201d \u201ccharity,\u201d and the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This affords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.\r\n\r\nOliver had been sojourning at the undertaker\u2019s some three weeks or a month. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry\u2014the shop being shut up\u2014were taking their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his wife, said,\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear\u2014\u201d He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, my dear, nothing,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cUgh, you brute!\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me what you were going to say,\u201d interposed Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cI am nobody; don\u2019t consult me, pray. I don\u2019t want to intrude upon your secrets.\u201d As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, my dear,\u201d said Sowerberry, \u201cI want to ask your advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t ask mine,\u201d replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting manner: \u201cask somebody else\u2019s.\u201d Here, there was another hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear. After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only about young Twist, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry. \u201cA very good-looking boy, that, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe need be, for he eats enough,\u201d observed the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,\u201d resumed Mr. Sowerberry, \u201cwhich is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation on the good lady\u2019s part, proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but only for children\u2019s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in proportion, my dear. You may depend upon it, it would have a superb effect.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances, she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband\u2019s mind before? Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance; \u201can order for a coffin, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like himself, was very corpulent.\r\n\r\n\u201cBayton,\u201d said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr. Bumble. \u201cI never heard the name before.\u201d\r\n\r\nBumble shook his head, as he replied, \u201cObstinate people, Mr. Sowerberry; very obstinate. Proud, too, I\u2019m afraid, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProud, eh?\u201d exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. \u201cCome, that\u2019s too much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s sickening,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cAntimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is,\u201d acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe only heard of the family the night before last,\u201d said the beadle; \u201cand we shouldn\u2019t have known anything about them, then, only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad. He had gone out to dinner; but his \u2019prentice (which is a very clever lad) sent \u2019em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, there\u2019s promptness,\u201d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cPromptness, indeed!\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cBut what\u2019s the consequence; what\u2019s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won\u2019t suit his wife\u2019s complaint, and so she shan\u2019t take it\u2014says she shan\u2019t take it, sir! Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before\u2014sent \u2019em for nothing, with a blackin\u2019-bottle in,\u2014and he sends back word that she shan\u2019t take it, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble\u2019s mind in full force, he struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with indignation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cI ne\u2014ver\u2014did\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever did, sir!\u201d ejaculated the beadle. \u201cNo, nor nobody never did; but now she\u2019s dead, we\u2019ve got to bury her; and that\u2019s the direction; and the sooner it\u2019s done, the better.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble\u2019s voice. He needn\u2019t have taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble\u2019s glance, however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, \u201cthe sooner this job is done, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap, and come with me.\u201d Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his professional mission.\r\n\r\nThey walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house which was the object of their search. The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body. The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine.\r\n\r\nThere was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.\r\n\r\nIt was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed him.\r\n\r\nThere was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket. Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe man\u2019s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot. The old woman\u2019s face was wrinkled; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside.\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody shall go near her,\u201d said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess. \u201cKeep back! Damn you, keep back, if you\u2019ve a life to lose!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense, my good man,\u201d said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes. \u201cNonsense!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you,\u201d said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously on the floor,\u2014\u201cI tell you I won\u2019t have her put into the ground. She couldn\u2019t rest there. The worms would worry her\u2014not eat her\u2014she is so worn away.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman; \u201ckneel down, kneel down\u2014kneel round her, every one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death. I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her bones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor candle; she died in the dark\u2014in the dark! She couldn\u2019t even see her children\u2019s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death. I swear it before the God that saw it! They starved her!\u201d He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering his lips.\r\n\r\nThe terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed, menaced them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was my daughter,\u201d said the old woman, nodding her head in the direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. \u201cLord, Lord! Well, it is strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and stiff! Lord, Lord!\u2014to think of it; it\u2019s as good as a play\u2014as good as a play!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, stop!\u201d said the old woman in a loud whisper. \u201cWill she be buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night? I laid her out; and I must walk, you know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold. We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send some bread\u2014only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some bread, dear?\u201d she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker\u2019s coat, as he once more moved towards the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cof course. Anything you like!\u201d He disengaged himself from the old woman\u2019s grasp; and, drawing Oliver after him, hurried away.\r\n\r\nThe next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as bearers. An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!\u201d whispered Sowerberry in the old woman\u2019s ear; \u201cwe are rather late; and it won\u2019t do, to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,\u2014as quick as you like!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two mourners kept as near them, as they could. Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his master\u2019s, ran by the side.\r\n\r\nThere was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so, before he came. So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave. Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice as he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Bill!\u201d said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. \u201cFill up!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The grave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, my good fellow!\u201d said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. \u201cThey want to shut up the yard.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon. The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on their different ways.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Oliver,\u201d said Sowerberry, as they walked home, \u201chow do you like it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty well, thank you, sir\u201d replied Oliver, with considerable hesitation. \u201cNot very much, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you\u2019ll get used to it in time, Oliver,\u201d said Sowerberry. \u201cNothing when you are used to it, my boy.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nOLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM\r\n\r\nThe month\u2019s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberry\u2019s ingenious speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses.\r\n\r\nFor instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be\u2014quite cheerful and contented\u2014conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them. Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.\r\n\r\nThat Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver\u2019s history; for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings.\r\n\r\nOne day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton\u2014a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck\u2014when Charlotte being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.\r\n\r\nIntent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table-cloth; and pulled Oliver\u2019s hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a \u201csneak\u201d; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was. But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny. He got rather personal.\r\n\r\n\u201cWork\u2019us,\u201d said Noah, \u201chow\u2019s your mother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d replied Oliver; \u201cdon\u2019t you say anything about her to me!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying. Under this impression he returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she die of, Work\u2019us?\u201d said Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,\u201d replied Oliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. \u201cI think I know what it must be to die of that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work\u2019us,\u201d said Noah, as a tear rolled down Oliver\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s set you a snivelling now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot you,\u201d replied Oliver, sharply. \u201cThere; that\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t say anything more to me about her; you\u2019d better not!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter not!\u201d exclaimed Noah. \u201cWell! Better not! Work\u2019us, don\u2019t be impudent. Your mother, too! She was a nice \u2019un she was. Oh, Lor!\u201d And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion.\r\n\r\n\u201cYer know, Work\u2019us,\u201d continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver\u2019s silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most annoying: \u201cYer know, Work\u2019us, it can\u2019t be helped now; and of course yer couldn\u2019t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I\u2019m sure we all are, and pity yer very much. But yer must know, Work\u2019us, yer mother was a regular right-down bad \u2019un.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA regular right-down bad \u2019un, Work\u2019us,\u201d replied Noah, coolly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a great deal better, Work\u2019us, that she died when she did, or else she\u2019d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung; which is more likely than either, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\nCrimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table; seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow, felled him to the ground.\r\n\r\nA minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll murder me!\u201d blubbered Noah. \u201cCharlotte! missis! Here\u2019s the new boy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver\u2019s gone mad! Char\u2014lotte!\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah\u2019s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further down.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you little wretch!\u201d screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training. \u201cOh, you little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!\u201d And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of society.\r\n\r\nCharlotte\u2019s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not be effectual in calming Oliver\u2019s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she scratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.\r\n\r\nThis was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless her, she\u2019s going off!\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cA glass of water, Noah, dear. Make haste!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! Charlotte,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she could, through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. \u201cOh! Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! mercy indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI only hope this\u2019ll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He was all but killed, ma\u2019am, when I come in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the charity-boy.\r\n\r\nNoah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver\u2019s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed some affecting tears and sniffs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to be done!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cYour master\u2019s not at home; there\u2019s not a man in the house, and he\u2019ll kick that door down in ten minutes.\u201d Oliver\u2019s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly probable.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, dear! I don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cunless we send for the police-officers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr the millingtary,\u201d suggested Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver\u2019s old friend. \u201cRun to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It\u2019ll keep the swelling down.\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nOLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with the boy!\u201d said the old pauper.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,\u2014which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Bumble, sir!\u201d said Noah: \u201cOliver, sir,\u2014Oliver has\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat? What?\u201d interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes. \u201cNot run away; he hasn\u2019t run away, has he, Noah?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he\u2019s turned wicious,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cHe tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony, please, sir!\u201d And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.\r\n\r\nWhen Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman\u2019s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, \u201cwho has been nearly murdered\u2014all but murdered, sir,\u2014by young Twist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Jove!\u201d exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short. \u201cI knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd his missis,\u201d interposed Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd his master, too, I think you said, Noah?\u201d added Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! he\u2019s out, or he would have murdered him,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cHe said he wanted to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?\u201d inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cAnd please, sir, missis wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him\u2014\u2019cause master\u2019s out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, my boy; certainly,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah\u2019s head, which was about three inches higher than his own. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy\u2014a very good boy. Here\u2019s a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry\u2019s with your cane, and see what\u2019s best to be done. Don\u2019t spare him, Bumble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I will not, sir,\u201d replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner\u2019s satisfaction, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\nHere the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. With this view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome; you let me out!\u201d replied Oliver, from the inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know this here voice, Oliver?\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cAin\u2019t you afraid of it, sir? Ain\u2019t you a-trembling while I speak, sir?\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d replied Oliver, boldly.\r\n\r\nAn answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Madness, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of deep meditation. \u201cIt\u2019s Meat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cMeat, ma\u2019am, meat,\u201d replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. \u201cYou\u2019ve over-fed him, ma\u2019am. You\u2019ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma\u2019am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have paupers to do with soul or spirit? It\u2019s quite enough that we let \u2019em have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma\u2019am, this would never have happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, dear!\u201d ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling: \u201cthis comes of being liberal!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble\u2019s heavy accusation. Of which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again; \u201cthe only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he\u2019s a little starved down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman, weeks before.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this point of Mr. Bumble\u2019s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible. Sowerberry returned at this juncture. Oliver\u2019s offence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead. The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, you are a nice young fellow, ain\u2019t you?\u201d said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe called my mother names,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cShe deserved what he said, and worse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe did,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie!\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nThis flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter. To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went\u2014it was not very extensive\u2014kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble\u2019s subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day\u2019s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive. But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him!\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy\u2019s eyes, farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still. He softly reclosed the door. Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.\r\n\r\nWith the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look around\u2014one moment\u2019s pause of hesitation\u2014he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street.\r\n\r\nHe looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.\r\n\r\nHe remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.\r\n\r\nAlong this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm. His way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back. He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so. Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on.\r\n\r\nHe reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, Dick!\u201d said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him. \u201cIs any one up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody but me,\u201d replied the child.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou musn\u2019t say you saw me, Dick,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI am running away. They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off. I don\u2019t know where. How pale you are!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard the doctor tell them I was dying,\u201d replied the child with a faint smile. \u201cI am very glad to see you, dear; but don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, I will, to say good-b\u2019ye to you,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cI shall see you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d replied the child. \u201cAfter I am dead, but not before. I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake. Kiss me,\u201d said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver\u2019s neck. \u201cGood-b\u2019ye, dear! God bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe blessing was from a young child\u2019s lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nOLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN\r\n\r\nOliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more gained the high-road. It was eight o\u2019clock now. Though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he had better go and try to live.\r\n\r\nThe stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy\u2019s mind.\r\n\r\nLondon!\u2014that great place!\u2014nobody\u2014not even Mr. Bumble\u2014could ever find him there! He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward.\r\n\r\nHe had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting there. He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his bundle. He had a penny too\u2014a gift of Sowerberry\u2019s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well\u2014in his pocket. \u201cA clean shirt,\u201d thought Oliver, \u201cis a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles\u2019 walk in winter time.\u201d But Oliver\u2019s thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.\r\n\r\nOliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side. When the night came, he turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning. He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had ever felt before. Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.\r\n\r\nHe felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village through which he passed. He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along.\r\n\r\nHe waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn\u2019t deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.\r\n\r\nIn some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail. This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition. In others, he would stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady\u2019s ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he begged at a farmer\u2019s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle\u2014which brought Oliver\u2019s heart into his mouth,\u2014very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver\u2019s troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother\u2019s; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king\u2019s highway. But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could afford\u2014and more\u2014with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver\u2019s soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.\r\n\r\nEarly on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day. The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.\r\n\r\nHe had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo, my covey! What\u2019s the row?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen. He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man. He was short of his age: with rather bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment\u2014and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old place again. He wore a man\u2019s coat, which reached nearly to his heels. He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them. He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers.\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo, my covey! What\u2019s the row?\u201d said this strange young gentleman to Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very hungry and tired,\u201d replied Oliver: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke. \u201cI have walked a long way. I have been walking these seven days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWalking for sivin days!\u201d said the young gentleman. \u201cOh, I see. Beak\u2019s order, eh? But,\u201d he added, noticing Oliver\u2019s look of surprise, \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird\u2019s mouth described by the term in question.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy eyes, how green!\u201d exclaimed the young gentleman. \u201cWhy, a beak\u2019s a madgst\u2019rate; and when you walk by a beak\u2019s order, it\u2019s not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. Was you never on the mill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat mill?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat mill! Why, the mill\u2014the mill as takes up so little room that it\u2019ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind\u2019s low with people, than when it\u2019s high; acos then they can\u2019t get workmen. But come,\u201d said the young gentleman; \u201cyou want grub, and you shall have it. I\u2019m at low-water-mark myself\u2014only one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I\u2019ll fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There! Now then! Morrice!\u201d\r\n\r\nAssisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler\u2019s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, \u201ca fourpenny bran!\u201d the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his new friend\u2019s bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing to London?\u201d said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length concluded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGot any lodgings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you live in London?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I do, when I\u2019m at home,\u201d replied the boy. \u201cI suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night, don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do, indeed,\u201d answered Oliver. \u201cI have not slept under a roof since I left the country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret your eyelids on that score,\u201d said the young gentleman. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a \u2019spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot\u2019ll give you lodgings for nothink, and never ask for the change\u2014that is, if any genelman he knows interduces you. And don\u2019t he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means. Certainly not!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his friend\u2019s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkin\u2019s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron\u2019s interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of \u201cThe Artful Dodger,\u201d Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him. Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAs John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven o\u2019clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington. They crossed from the Angel into St. John\u2019s Road; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed or harmless errands.\r\n\r\nOliver was just considering whether he hadn\u2019t better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor, catching him by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him into the passage, closed it behind them.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then!\u201d cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlummy and slam!\u201d was the reply.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a man\u2019s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s two on you,\u201d said the man, thrusting the candle farther out, and shielding his eyes with his hand. \u201cWho\u2019s the t\u2019other one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA new pal,\u201d replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGreenland. Is Fagin upstairs?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s a sortin\u2019 the wipes. Up with you!\u201d The candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared.\r\n\r\nOliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them.\r\n\r\nHe threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.\r\n\r\nThe walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt. There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate. In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. Several rough beds made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men. These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is him, Fagin,\u201d said Jack Dawkins; \u201cmy friend Oliver Twist.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance. Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands very hard\u2014especially the one in which he held his little bundle. One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to bed. These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew\u2019s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cDodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah, you\u2019re a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a good many of \u2019em, ain\u2019t there? We\u2019ve just looked \u2019em out, ready for the wash; that\u2019s all, Oliver; that\u2019s all. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of which they went to supper.\r\n\r\nOliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired. Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nCONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS\r\n\r\nIt was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.\r\n\r\nOliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan\u2019s sides: and yet the self-same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known.\r\n\r\nWhen the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob. Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in. Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin. \u201cClever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn\u2019t have loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.\r\n\r\nHaving replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it\u2019s a fine thing for the trade! Five of \u2019em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn white-livered!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver\u2019s face; the boy\u2019s eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an instant\u2014for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived\u2014it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.\r\n\r\nHe closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said the Jew. \u201cWhat do you watch me for? Why are you awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick\u2014quick! for your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to sleep any longer, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, meekly. \u201cI am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not awake an hour ago?\u201d said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! No, indeed!\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before: and a threatening attitude.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon my word I was not, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, earnestly. \u201cI was not, indeed, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTush, tush, my dear!\u201d said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. \u201cOf course I know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You\u2019re a brave boy. Ha! ha! you\u2019re a brave boy, Oliver.\u201d The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you see any of these pretty things, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the Jew, turning rather pale. \u201cThey\u2014they\u2019re mine, Oliver; my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\u201d replied the old gentleman. \u201cStay. There\u2019s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here; and I\u2019ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew\u2019s directions, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself to the Dodger, \u201cI hope you\u2019ve been at work this morning, my dears?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHard,\u201d replied the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs nails,\u201d added Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boys, good boys!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cWhat have you got, Dodger?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA couple of pocket-books,\u201d replied that young gentlman.\r\n\r\n\u201cLined?\u201d inquired the Jew, with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty well,\u201d replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one green, and the other red.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so heavy as they might be,\u201d said the Jew, after looking at the insides carefully; \u201cbut very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman, ain\u2019t he, Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery indeed, sir,\u201d said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had passed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what have you got, my dear?\u201d said Fagin to Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cWipes,\u201d replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Jew, inspecting them closely; \u201cthey\u2019re very good ones, very. You haven\u2019t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we\u2019ll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, sir,\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much, indeed, if you\u2019ll teach me, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is so jolly green!\u201d said Charley when he recovered, as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver\u2019s hair over his eyes, and said he\u2019d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing Oliver\u2019s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning? This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious.\r\n\r\nWhen the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn\u2019t lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the spectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again.\r\n\r\nWhen this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings. They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.\r\n\r\nThe visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof. This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cThat\u2019s a pleasant life, isn\u2019t it? They have gone out for the day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave they done work, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cthat is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won\u2019t neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it. Make \u2019em your models, my dear. Make \u2019em your models,\u201d tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words; \u201cdo everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters\u2014especially the Dodger\u2019s, my dear. He\u2019ll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.\u2014Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, stopping short.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do, when we were at play this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it gone?\u201d cried the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere it is, sir,\u201d said Oliver, showing it in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a clever boy, my dear,\u201d said the playful old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly. \u201cI never saw a sharper lad. Here\u2019s a shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you\u2019ll be the greatest man of the time. And now come here, and I\u2019ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver wondered what picking the old gentleman\u2019s pocket in play, had to do with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nOLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\nFor many days, Oliver remained in the Jew\u2019s room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length, he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions.\r\n\r\nOliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman\u2019s character. Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed, he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.\r\n\r\nAt length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman\u2019s giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.\r\n\r\nThe three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in, first.\r\n\r\nThe pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction. These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.\r\n\r\nThey were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, \u201cThe Green\u201d: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d demanded Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d replied the Dodger. \u201cDo you see that old cove at the book-stall?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe old gentleman over the way?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cYes, I see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cA prime plant,\u201d observed Master Charley Bates.\r\n\r\nOliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness.\r\n\r\nWhat was Oliver\u2019s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman\u2019s pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed!\r\n\r\nIn an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy\u2019s mind.\r\n\r\nHe stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.\r\n\r\nThis was all done in a minute\u2019s space. In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting \u201cStop thief!\u201d with all his might, made off after him, book in hand.\r\n\r\nBut the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting \u201cStop thief!\u201d too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, \u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d There is a passion FOR hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy. \u201cStop thief!\u201d Ay, stop him for God\u2019s sake, were it only in mercy!\r\n\r\nStopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse. \u201cStand aside!\u201d \u201cGive him a little air!\u201d \u201cNonsense! he don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the gentleman?\u201d \u201cHere his is, coming down the street.\u201d \u201cMake room there for the gentleman!\u201d \u201cIs this the boy, sir!\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cI am afraid it is the boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfraid!\u201d murmured the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s a good \u2019un!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said the gentleman, \u201che has hurt himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did that, sir,\u201d said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward; \u201cand preciously I cut my knuckle agin\u2019 his mouth. I stopped him, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, get up,\u201d said the man, roughly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,\u201d said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. \u201cThey are here somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, they ain\u2019t,\u201d said the officer. He meant this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, get up!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him,\u201d said the old gentleman, compassionately.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, I won\u2019t hurt him,\u201d replied the officer, tearing his jacket half off his back, in proof thereof. \u201cCome, I know you; it won\u2019t do. Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at a rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officer\u2019s side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE\r\n\r\nThe offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office. The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way. It was a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d said the man carelessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young fogle-hunter,\u201d replied the man who had Oliver in charge.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you the party that\u2019s been robbed, sir?\u201d inquired the man with the keys.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the old gentleman; \u201cbut I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief. I\u2014I would rather not press the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMust go before the magistrate now, sir,\u201d replied the man. \u201cHis worship will be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young gallows!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.\r\n\r\nThis cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so light. It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night. But this is little. In our station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges\u2014the word is worth noting\u2014in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who doubts this, compare the two.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something in that boy\u2019s face,\u201d said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; \u201csomething that touches and interests me. Can he be innocent? He looked like\u2014Bye the bye,\u201d exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, \u201cBless my soul!\u2014where have I seen something like that look before?\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before his mind\u2019s eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years. \u201cNo,\u201d said the old gentleman, shaking his head; \u201cit must be imagination.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.\r\n\r\nBut the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver\u2019s features bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book.\r\n\r\nHe was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office. He closed his book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\nThe office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. Mr. Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene.\r\n\r\nMr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his head. His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate\u2019s desk, said, suiting the action to the word, \u201cThat is my name and address, sir.\u201d He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. He was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.\r\n\r\n\u201cOfficer!\u201d said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper. \u201cWho is this fellow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name, sir,\u201d said the old gentleman, speaking like a gentleman, \u201cmy name, sir, is Brownlow. Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person, under the protection of the bench.\u201d Saying this, Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information.\r\n\r\n\u201cOfficer!\u201d said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, \u201cwhat\u2019s this fellow charged with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not charged at all, your worship,\u201d replied the officer. \u201cHe appears against this boy, your worship.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a safe one.\r\n\r\n\u201cAppears against the boy, does he?\u201d said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr. Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot. \u201cSwear him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cand that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have believed\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, sir!\u201d said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not, sir!\u201d replied the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue this instant, or I\u2019ll have you turned out of the office!\u201d said Mr. Fang. \u201cYou\u2019re an insolent impertinent fellow. How dare you bully a magistrate!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.\r\n\r\n\u201cSwear this person!\u201d said Fang to the clerk. \u201cI\u2019ll not hear another word. Swear him.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow\u2019s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Fang, \u201cwhat\u2019s the charge against this boy? What have you got to say, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was standing at a bookstall\u2014\u201d Mr. Brownlow began.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, sir,\u201d said Mr. Fang. \u201cPoliceman! Where\u2019s the policeman? Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what is this?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre there any witnesses?\u201d inquired Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone, your worship,\u201d replied the policeman.\r\n\r\nMr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the prosecutor, said in a towering passion.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not? You have been sworn. Now, if you stand there, refusing to give evidence, I\u2019ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will, by\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBy what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being heard\u2014accidently, of course.\r\n\r\nWith many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has been hurt already,\u201d said the old gentleman in conclusion. \u201cAnd I fear,\u201d he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, \u201cI really fear that he is ill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! yes, I dare say!\u201d said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. \u201cCome, none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won\u2019t do. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him. He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, you hardened scoundrel?\u201d demanded Mr. Fang. \u201cOfficer, what\u2019s his name?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was standing by the bar. He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says his name\u2019s Tom White, your worship,\u201d said the kind-hearted thief-taker.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he won\u2019t speak out, won\u2019t he?\u201d said Fang. \u201cVery well, very well. Where does he live?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere he can, your worship,\u201d replied the officer; again pretending to receive Oliver\u2019s answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he any parents?\u201d inquired Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says they died in his infancy, your worship,\u201d replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water.\r\n\r\n\u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Mr. Fang: \u201cdon\u2019t try to make a fool of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think he really is ill, your worship,\u201d remonstrated the officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know better,\u201d said Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake care of him, officer,\u201d said the old gentleman, raising his hands instinctively; \u201che\u2019ll fall down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStand away, officer,\u201d cried Fang; \u201clet him, if he likes.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a fainting fit. The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to stir.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew he was shamming,\u201d said Fang, as if this were incontestable proof of the fact. \u201cLet him lie there; he\u2019ll soon be tired of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you propose to deal with the case, sir?\u201d inquired the clerk in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cSummarily,\u201d replied Mr. Fang. \u201cHe stands committed for three months\u2014hard labour of course. Clear the office.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, stop! don\u2019t take him away! For Heaven\u2019s sake stop a moment!\u201d cried the new comer, breathless with haste.\r\n\r\nAlthough the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects, especially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press.[Footnote: Or were virtually, then.] Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the office!\u201d cried Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will speak,\u201d cried the man; \u201cI will not be turned out. I saw it all. I keep the book-stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be put down. Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You must not refuse, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man was right. His manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up.\r\n\r\n\u201cSwear the man,\u201d growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. \u201cNow, man, what have you got to say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the man: \u201cI saw three boys: two others and the prisoner here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.\u201d Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come here before?\u201d said Fang, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t a soul to mind the shop,\u201d replied the man. \u201cEverybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I\u2019ve run here all the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe prosecutor was reading, was he?\u201d inquired Fang, after another pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied the man. \u201cThe very book he has in his hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that book, eh?\u201d said Fang. \u201cIs it paid for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not,\u201d replied the man, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, I forgot all about it!\u201d exclaimed the absent old gentleman, innocently.\r\n\r\n\u201cA nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!\u201d said Fang, with a comical effort to look humane. \u201cI consider, sir, that you have obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet. The boy is discharged. Clear the office!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cD\u2014n me!\u201d cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long, \u201cd\u2014n me! I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClear the office!\u201d said the magistrate. \u201cOfficers, do you hear? Clear the office!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance. He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment. Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor boy, poor boy!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. \u201cCall a coach, somebody, pray. Directly!\u201d\r\n\r\nA coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I accompany you?\u201d said the book-stall keeper, looking in.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless me, yes, my dear sir,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow quickly. \u201cI forgot you. Dear, dear! I have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor fellow! There\u2019s no time to lose.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nIN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nThe coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville. Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nBut, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever. The worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame.\r\n\r\nWeak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream. Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat room is this? Where have I been brought to?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cThis is not the place I went to sleep in.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but they were overheard at once. The curtain at the bed\u2019s head was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which she had been sitting at needle-work.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, my dear,\u201d said the old lady softly. \u201cYou must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,\u2014as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh. Lie down again; there\u2019s a dear!\u201d With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver\u2019s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cSave us!\u201d said the old lady, with tears in her eyes. \u201cWhat a grateful little dear it is. Pretty creetur! What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps she does see me,\u201d whispered Oliver, folding his hands together; \u201cperhaps she has sat by me. I almost feel as if she had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was the fever, my dear,\u201d said the old lady mildly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose it was,\u201d replied Oliver, \u201cbecause heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy. But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died. She can\u2019t know anything about me though,\u201d added Oliver after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cIf she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again.\r\n\r\nSo, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said. He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are a great deal better, are you not, my dear?\u201d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, thank you, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know you are,\u201d said the gentleman: \u201cYou\u2019re hungry too, an\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d answered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cHem!\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cNo, I know you\u2019re not. He is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin,\u201d said the gentleman: looking very wise.\r\n\r\nThe old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou feel sleepy, don\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleepy. Nor thirsty. Are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, rather thirsty,\u201d answered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural that he should be thirsty. You may give him a little tea, ma\u2019am, and some dry toast without any butter. Don\u2019t keep him too warm, ma\u2019am; but be careful that you don\u2019t let him be too cold; will you have the goodness?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady dropped a curtsey. The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs.\r\n\r\nOliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve o\u2019clock. The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come: bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep again.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the night crept slowly on. Oliver lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy\u2019s mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven.\r\n\r\nGradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from. Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past!\r\n\r\nIt had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt cheerful and happy. The crisis of the disease was safely past. He belonged to the world again.\r\n\r\nIn three days\u2019 time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper\u2019s room, which belonged to her. Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most violently.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind me, my dear,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cI\u2019m only having a regular good cry. There; it\u2019s all over now; and I\u2019m quite comfortable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very, very kind to me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, never you mind that, my dear,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cthat\u2019s got nothing to do with your broth; and it\u2019s full time you had it; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he\u2019ll be pleased.\u201d And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you fond of pictures, dear?\u201d inquired the old lady, seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against the wall; just opposite his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite know, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver, without taking his eyes from the canvas; \u201cI have seen so few that I hardly know. What a beautiful, mild face that lady\u2019s is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the old lady, \u201cpainters always make ladies out prettier than they are, or they wouldn\u2019t get any custom, child. The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed; it\u2019s a deal too honest. A deal,\u201d said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own acuteness.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs\u2014is that a likeness, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth; \u201cthat\u2019s a portrait.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, really, my dear, I don\u2019t know,\u201d answered the old lady in a good-humoured manner. \u201cIt\u2019s not a likeness of anybody that you or I know, I expect. It seems to strike your fancy, dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is so pretty,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, sure you\u2019re not afraid of it?\u201d said the old lady: observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, no,\u201d returned Oliver quickly; \u201cbut the eyes look so sorrowful; and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. It makes my heart beat,\u201d added Oliver in a low voice, \u201cas if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord save us!\u201d exclaimed the old lady, starting; \u201cdon\u2019t talk in that way, child. You\u2019re weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you won\u2019t see it. There!\u201d said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; \u201cyou don\u2019t see it now, at all events.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver did see it in his mind\u2019s eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition. He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nNow, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions. Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow\u2019s heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor boy, poor boy!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. \u201cI\u2019m rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin. I\u2019m afraid I have caught cold.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Bedwin. \u201cEverything you have had, has been well aired, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Bedwin. I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cI rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind that. How do you feel, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery happy, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cAnd very grateful indeed, sir, for your goodness to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. \u201cHave you given him any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Bedwin: drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the last word: to intimate that between slops, and broth well compounded, there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; \u201ca couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn\u2019t they, Tom White, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Oliver, sir,\u201d replied the little invalid: with a look of great astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cOliver what? Oliver White, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQueer name!\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cWhat made you tell the magistrate your name was White?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never told him so, sir,\u201d returned Oliver in amazement.\r\n\r\nThis sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver\u2019s face. It was impossible to doubt him; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome mistake,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. But, although his motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you are not angry with me, sir?\u201d said Oliver, raising his eyes beseechingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied the old gentleman. \u201cWhy! what\u2019s this? Bedwin, look there!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver\u2019s head, and then to the boy\u2019s face. There was its living copy. The eyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy!\r\n\r\nOliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away. A weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording\u2014\r\n\r\nThat when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver\u2019s heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow\u2019s personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature\u2019s deeds and actions: the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady\u2019s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For, these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut. Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves. Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway. Having remained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d inquired the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha! ha!\u201d roared Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your noise,\u201d remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. \u201cDo you want to be grabbed, stupid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Charley, \u201cI can\u2019t help it! To see him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again\u2019 the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him\u2014oh, my eye!\u201d The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours. As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll Fagin say?\u201d inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d repeated Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, what?\u201d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what should he say?\u201d inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly in his merriment; for the Dodger\u2019s manner was impressive. \u201cWhat should he say?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat, scratched his head, and nodded thrice.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Charley.\r\n\r\n\u201cToor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn\u2019t, and high cockolorum,\u201d said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance.\r\n\r\nThis was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so; and again said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court. Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.\r\n\r\nThe noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, how\u2019s this?\u201d muttered the Jew: changing countenance; \u201conly two of \u2019em? Where\u2019s the third? They can\u2019t have got into trouble. Hark!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind them.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nSOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Oliver?\u201d said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. \u201cWhere\u2019s the boy?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence; and looked uneasily at each other. But they made no reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s become of the boy?\u201d said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations. \u201cSpeak out, or I\u2019ll throttle you!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar\u2014something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you speak?\u201d thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the traps have got him, and that\u2019s all about it,\u201d said the Dodger, sullenly. \u201cCome, let go o\u2019 me, will you!\u201d And, swinging himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the Jew\u2019s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at the merry old gentleman\u2019s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced.\r\n\r\nThe Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant\u2019s head. But Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what the blazes is in the wind now!\u201d growled a deep voice. \u201cWho pitched that \u2019ere at me? It\u2019s well it\u2019s the beer, and not the pot, as hit me, or I\u2019d have settled somebody. I might have know\u2019d, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water\u2014and not that, unless he done the River Company every quarter. Wot\u2019s it all about, Fagin? D\u2014me, if my neck-handkercher an\u2019t lined with beer! Come in, you sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master! Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;\u2014the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them. He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke. He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days\u2019 growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d growled this engaging ruffian.\r\n\r\nA white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places, skulked into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in afore?\u201d said the man. \u201cYou\u2019re getting too proud to own me afore company, are you? Lie down!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the other end of the room. He appeared well used to it, however; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you up to? Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious, in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?\u201d said the man, seating himself deliberately. \u201cI wonder they don\u2019t murder you! I would if I was them. If I\u2019d been your \u2019prentice, I\u2019d have done it long ago, and\u2014no, I couldn\u2019t have sold you afterwards, for you\u2019re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don\u2019t blow glass bottles large enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! hush! Mr. Sikes,\u201d said the Jew, trembling; \u201cdon\u2019t speak so loud!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of your mistering,\u201d replied the ruffian; \u201cyou always mean mischief when you come that. You know my name: out with it! I shan\u2019t disgrace it when the time comes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, then\u2014Bill Sikes,\u201d said the Jew, with abject humility. \u201cYou seem out of humour, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I am,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cI should think you was rather out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about, as you do when you blab and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you mad?\u201d said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and pointing towards the boys.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly. He then, in cant terms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass of liquor.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd mind you don\u2019t poison it,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the table.\r\n\r\nThis was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all events) to improve upon the distiller\u2019s ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman\u2019s merry heart.\r\n\r\nAfter swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver\u2019s capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d said the Jew, \u201cthat he may say something which will get us into trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very likely,\u201d returned Sikes with a malicious grin. \u201cYou\u2019re blowed upon, Fagin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid, you see,\u201d added the Jew, speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did so,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man started, and turned round upon the Jew. But the old gentleman\u2019s shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomebody must find out wot\u2019s been done at the office,\u201d said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he hasn\u2019t peached, and is committed, there\u2019s no fear till he comes out again,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, \u201cand then he must be taken care on. You must get hold of him somehow.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain the Jew nodded.\r\n\r\nThe prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but, unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being adopted. This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or pretext whatever.\r\n\r\nHow long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess. It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe very thing!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cBet will go; won\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWheres?\u201d inquired the young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly just up to the office, my dear,\u201d said the Jew coaxingly.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be \u201cblessed\u201d if she would; a polite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.\r\n\r\nThe Jew\u2019s countenance fell. He turned from this young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow curl-papers, to the other female.\r\n\r\n\u201cNancy, my dear,\u201d said the Jew in a soothing manner, \u201cwhat do you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat it won\u2019t do; so it\u2019s no use a-trying it on, Fagin,\u201d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I say, Bill,\u201d replied the lady collectedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re just the very person for it,\u201d reasoned Mr. Sikes: \u201cnobody about here knows anything of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd as I don\u2019t want \u2019em to, neither,\u201d replied Nancy in the same composed manner, \u201cit\u2019s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll go, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she won\u2019t, Fagin,\u201d said Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she will, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission. She was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,\u2014both articles of dress being provided from the Jew\u2019s inexhaustible stock,\u2014Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop a minute, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, producing, a little covered basket. \u201cCarry that in one hand. It looks more respectable, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive her a door-key to carry in her t\u2019other one, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cit looks real and genivine like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, my dear, so it does,\u201d said the Jew, hanging a large street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady\u2019s right hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere; very good! Very good indeed, my dear!\u201d said the Jew, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!\u201d exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the street-door key in an agony of distress. \u201cWhat has become of him! Where have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what\u2019s been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone: to the immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, she\u2019s a clever girl, my dears,\u201d said the Jew, turning round to his young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a honour to her sex,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and smiting the table with his enormous fist. \u201cHere\u2019s her health, and wishing they was all like her!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nEntering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and listened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cNolly, dear?\u201d murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; \u201cNolly?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument. He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d cried a faint and feeble voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there a little boy here?\u201d inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the voice; \u201cGod forbid.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for not playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and doing nothing for his livelihood. In the next cell was another man, who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the Stamp-office.\r\n\r\nBut, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear brother.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got him, my dear,\u201d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the gentleman\u2019s got him,\u201d replied the officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?\u201d exclaimed Nancy.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own residence: of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman.\r\n\r\nIn a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of, to the domicile of the Jew.\r\n\r\nMr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, expeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good-morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,\u201d said the Jew greatly excited. \u201cCharley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring home some news of him! Nancy, my dear, I must have him found. I trust to you, my dear,\u2014to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,\u201d added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; \u201cthere\u2019s money, my dears. I shall shut up this shop to-night. You\u2019ll know where to find me! Don\u2019t stop here a minute. Not an instant, my dears!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver. Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing.\r\n\r\nA rap at the door startled him in this occupation. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he cried in a shrill tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe!\u201d replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d cried the Jew impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?\u201d inquired the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied the Jew, \u201cwherever she lays hands on him. Find him, find him out, that\u2019s all. I shall know what to do next; never fear.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his companions.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has not peached so far,\u201d said the Jew as he pursued his occupation. \u201cIf he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nCOMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER\u2019S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW\u2019S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND\r\n\r\nOliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow\u2019s abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver\u2019s history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him. He was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he came down into the housekeeper\u2019s room next day, his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady. His expectations were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt is gone, you see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see it is ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWhy have they taken it away?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you know,\u201d rejoined the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, indeed. It didn\u2019t worry me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI liked to see it. I quite loved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d said the old lady, good-humouredly; \u201cyou get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There! I promise you that! Now, let us talk about something else.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time. As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them. When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea. After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach: and at which game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily to bed.\r\n\r\nThey were happy days, those of Oliver\u2019s recovery. Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself. He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him. As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself. This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again. They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk to him a little while.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely for you, child,\u201d said Mrs. Bedwin. \u201cDear heart alive! If we had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say: looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really didn\u2019t think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. On Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens. There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading. When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down. Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser. Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are a good many books, are there not, my boy?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cA great number, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cI never saw so many.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall read them, if you behave well,\u201d said the old gentleman kindly; \u201cand you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,\u2014that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,\u201d said Oliver, pointing to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot always those,\u201d said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head, and smiling as he did so; \u201cthere are other equally heavy ones, though of a much smaller size. How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I would rather read them, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! wouldn\u2019t you like to be a book-writer?\u201d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nOliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing. Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it was.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the old gentleman, composing his features. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! We won\u2019t make an author of you, while there\u2019s an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Oliver. At the earnest manner of his reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him assume yet, \u201cI want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say. I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!\u201d exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman\u2019s commencement! \u201cDon\u2019t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again. Let me stay here, and be a servant. Don\u2019t send me back to the wretched place I came from. Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear child,\u201d said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver\u2019s sudden appeal; \u201cyou need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never, never will, sir,\u201d interposed Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d rejoined the old gentleman. \u201cI do not think you ever will. I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself. The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections. Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, \u201cI only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again. You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement. Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you. Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door: and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he coming up?\u201d inquired Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied the servant. \u201cHe asked if there were any muffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I go downstairs, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cI would rather you remained here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a thick stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green. A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it. The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted, defy description. He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time: which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot. In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm\u2019s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here! do you see this! Isn\u2019t it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can\u2019t call at a man\u2019s house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon\u2019s friend on the staircase? I\u2019ve been lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I\u2019ll be content to eat my own head, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig\u2019s head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting\u2014to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll eat my head, sir,\u201d repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon the ground. \u201cHallo! what\u2019s that!\u201d looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nOliver bowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say that\u2019s the boy who had the fever, I hope?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more. \u201cWait a minute! Don\u2019t speak! Stop\u2014\u201d continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery; \u201cthat\u2019s the boy who had the orange! If that\u2019s not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I\u2019ll eat my head, and his too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, he has not had one,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. \u201cCome! Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel strongly on this subject, sir,\u201d said the irritable old gentleman, drawing off his gloves. \u201cThere\u2019s always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I know it\u2019s put there by the surgeon\u2019s boy at the corner. A young woman stumbled over a bit last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light. \u2018Don\u2019t go to him,\u2019 I called out of the window, \u2018he\u2019s an assassin! A man-trap!\u2019 So he is. If he is not\u2014\u201d Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the boy, is it?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, at length.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the boy,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you, boy?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cA great deal better, thank you, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the visitor\u2019s manner, he was very happy to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a nice-looking boy, is he not?\u201d inquired Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know. I never see any difference in boys. I only knew two sort of boys. Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd which is Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMealy. I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf. I know him! The wretch!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cthese are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist; so he needn\u2019t excite your wrath.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are not,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig. \u201cHe may have worse.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe may have worse, I say,\u201d repeated Mr. Grimwig. \u201cWhere does he come from! Who is he? What is he? He has had a fever. What of that? Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers sometimes; haven\u2019t they, eh? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master. He had had a fever six times; he wasn\u2019t recommended to mercy on that account. Pooh! nonsense!\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver\u2019s appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend. When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver\u2019s previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously. And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn\u2019t find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be content to\u2014and so forth.\r\n\r\nAll this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman: knowing his friend\u2019s peculiarities, bore with great good humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman\u2019s presence.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?\u201d asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he resumed his subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow morning,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI would rather he was alone with me at the time. Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o\u2019clock, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. He answered with some hesitation, because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig\u2019s looking so hard at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; \u201che won\u2019t come up to you to-morrow morning. I saw him hesitate. He is deceiving you, my good friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll swear he is not,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he is not,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d and down went the stick.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll answer for that boy\u2019s truth with my life!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, knocking the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I for his falsehood with my head!\u201d rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking the table also.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; \u201cwe will.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cthere is something to go back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has gone, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Bedwin.\r\n\r\n\u201cCall after him,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cit\u2019s particular. He is a poor man, and they are not paid for. There are some books to be taken back, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe street-door was opened. Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in sight. Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, I am very sorry for that,\u201d exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; \u201cI particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSend Oliver with them,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; \u201che will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI\u2019ll run all the way, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall go, my dear,\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThe books are on a chair by my table. Fetch them down.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to say,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; \u201cyou are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him. This is a five-pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be ten minutes, sir,\u201d said Oliver, eagerly. Having buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room. Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street: all of which Oliver said he clearly understood. Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to depart.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless his sweet face!\u201d said the old lady, looking after him. \u201cI can\u2019t bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and, closing the door, went back to her own room.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see; he\u2019ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table. \u201cIt will be dark by that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you really expect him to come back, do you?\u201d inquired Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig\u2019s breast, at the moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend\u2019s confident smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, smiting the table with his fist, \u201cI do not. The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket. He\u2019ll join his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you. If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I\u2019ll eat my head.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.\r\n\r\nIt grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nSHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE\r\n\r\nIn the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict.\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!\u201d said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog\u2019s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.\r\n\r\nDogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes\u2019s dog, having faults of temper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots. Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would, would you?\u201d said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew from his pocket. \u201cCome here, you born devil! Come here! D\u2019ye hear?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast.\r\n\r\nThis resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.\r\n\r\nThere must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog\u2019s participation, at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?\u201d said Sikes, with a fierce gesture.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know, my dear, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d replied Fagin, humbly; for the Jew was the new comer.\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know, you white-livered thief!\u201d growled Sikes. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you hear the noise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a sound of it, as I\u2019m a living man, Bill,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no! You hear nothing, you don\u2019t,\u201d retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer. \u201cSneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d inquired the Jew with a forced smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cCause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as haven\u2019t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,\u201d replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; \u201cthat\u2019s why.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill at ease, however.\r\n\r\n\u201cGrin away,\u201d said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with savage contempt; \u201cgrin away. You\u2019ll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it\u2019s behind a nightcap. I\u2019ve got the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d\u2014me, I\u2019ll keep it. There! If I go, you go; so take care of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, \u201cI know all that; we\u2014we\u2014have a mutual interest, Bill,\u2014a mutual interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHumph,\u201d said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew\u2019s side than on his. \u201cWell, what have you got to say to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all passed safe through the melting-pot,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cand this is your share. It\u2019s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you\u2019ll do me a good turn another time, and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStow that gammon,\u201d interposed the robber, impatiently. \u201cWhere is it? Hand over!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,\u201d replied the Jew, soothingly. \u201cHere it is! All safe!\u201d As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet. Sikes, snatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is all, is it?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?\u201d inquired Sikes, suspiciously. \u201cDon\u2019t put on an injured look at the question; you\u2019ve done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.\r\n\r\nBill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person. It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs anybody here, Barney?\u201d inquired Fagin; speaking, now that Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cDot a shoul,\u201d replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody?\u201d inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cDobody but Biss Dadsy,\u201d replied Barney.\r\n\r\n\u201cNancy!\u201d exclaimed Sikes. \u201cWhere? Strike me blind, if I don\u2019t honour that \u2019ere girl, for her native talents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,\u201d replied Barney.\r\n\r\n\u201cSend her here,\u201d said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. \u201cSend her here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBarney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are on the scent, are you, Nancy?\u201d inquired Sikes, proffering the glass.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I am, Bill,\u201d replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; \u201cand tired enough of it I am, too. The young brat\u2019s been ill and confined to the crib; and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Nancy, dear!\u201d said Fagin, looking up.\r\n\r\nNow, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew\u2019s red eye-brows, and a half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance. The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes\u2019 time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the book-stall. When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.\r\n\r\nHe was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud. \u201cOh, my dear brother!\u201d And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d cried Oliver, struggling. \u201cLet go of me. Who is it? What are you stopping me for?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street-door key in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh my gracious!\u201d said the young woman, \u201cI have found him! Oh! Oliver! Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I\u2019ve found him. Thank gracious goodness heavins, I\u2019ve found him!\u201d With these incoherent exclamations, the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher\u2019s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also looking on, whether he didn\u2019t think he had better run for the doctor. To which, the butcher\u2019s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, no, never mind,\u201d said the young woman, grasping Oliver\u2019s hand; \u201cI\u2019m better now. Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the young woman, \u201che ran away, near a month ago, from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his mother\u2019s heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung wretch!\u201d said one woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo home, do, you little brute,\u201d said the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not,\u201d replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. I haven\u2019t any sister, or father and mother either. I\u2019m an orphan; I live at Pentonville.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly hear him, how he braves it out!\u201d cried the young woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s Nancy!\u201d exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see he knows me!\u201d cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. \u201cHe can\u2019t help himself. Make him come home, there\u2019s good people, or he\u2019ll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil\u2019s this?\u201d said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with a white dog at his heels; \u201cyoung Oliver! Come home to your poor mother, you young dog! Come home directly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t belong to them. I don\u2019t know them. Help! help!\u201d cried Oliver, struggling in the man\u2019s powerful grasp.\r\n\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d repeated the man. \u201cYes; I\u2019ll help you, you young rascal! What books are these? You\u2019ve been a stealing \u2019em, have you? Give \u2019em here.\u201d With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck him on the head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way of bringing him to his senses!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure!\u201d cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look at the garret-window.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll do him good!\u201d said the two women.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he shall have it, too!\u201d rejoined the man, administering another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. \u201cCome on, you young villain! Here, Bull\u2019s-eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!\u201d\r\n\r\nWeak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be; what could one poor child do! Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless. In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible. It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain.\r\n\r\nThe gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nRELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY\r\n\r\nThe narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle-market. Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked. Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear?\u201d growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.\r\n\r\nThey were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.\r\n\r\nOliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me the other,\u201d said Sikes, seizing Oliver\u2019s unoccupied hand. \u201cHere, Bull\u2019s-Eye!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dog looked up, and growled.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, boy!\u201d said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver\u2019s throat; \u201cif he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! D\u2019ye mind!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn\u2019t!\u201d said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval. \u201cNow, you know what you\u2019ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game. Get on, young\u2019un!\u201d\r\n\r\nBull\u2019s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.\r\n\r\nIt was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night was dark and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver\u2019s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.\r\n\r\nThey had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the hour. With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cEight o\u2019clock, Bill,\u201d said Nancy, when the bell ceased.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can\u2019t I!\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder whether they can hear it,\u201d said Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course they can,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cIt was Bartlemy time when I was shopped; and there warn\u2019t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn\u2019t hear the squeaking on. Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded. \u201cOh, Bill, such fine young chaps as them!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; that\u2019s all you women think of,\u201d answered Sikes. \u201cFine young chaps! Well, they\u2019re as good as dead, so it don\u2019t much matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver\u2019s wrist more firmly, told him to step out again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute!\u201d said the girl: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurry by, if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o\u2019clock struck, Bill. I\u2019d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn\u2019t a shawl to cover me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what good would that do?\u201d inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes. \u201cUnless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me. Come on, and don\u2019t stand preaching there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and they walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white.\r\n\r\nThey walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full half-hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for many years.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.\r\n\r\nNancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell. They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp. A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house.\r\n\r\nThe passage was perfectly dark. They waited, while the person who had let them in, chained and barred the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnybody here?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the old \u2019un here?\u201d asked the robber.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied the voice, \u201cand precious down in the mouth he has been. Won\u2019t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to Oliver\u2019s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a glim,\u201d said Sikes, \u201cor we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStand still a moment, and I\u2019ll get you one,\u201d replied the voice. The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my wig, my wig!\u201d cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded: \u201chere he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin, look at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can\u2019t bear it; it is such a jolly game, I can\u2019t bear it. Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy. Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy. The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver\u2019s pockets with steady assiduity.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at his togs, Fagin!\u201d said Charley, putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. \u201cLook at his togs! Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And his books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDelighted to see you looking so well, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, bowing with mock humility. \u201cThe Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn\u2019t you write, my dear, and say you were coming? We\u2019d have got something warm for supper.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment.\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo, what\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized the note. \u201cThat\u2019s mine, Fagin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cMine, Bill, mine. You shall have the books.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that ain\u2019t mine!\u201d said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a determined air; \u201cmine and Nancy\u2019s that is; I\u2019ll take the boy back again.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome! Hand over, will you?\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?\u201d inquired the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cFair, or not fair,\u201d retorted Sikes, \u201chand over, I tell you! Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew\u2019s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for our share of the trouble,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cand not half enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you\u2019re fond of reading. If you ain\u2019t, sell \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re very pretty,\u201d said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; \u201cbeautiful writing, isn\u2019t is, Oliver?\u201d At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the first.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey belong to the old gentleman,\u201d said Oliver, wringing his hands; \u201cto the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books and money. Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back. He\u2019ll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them. Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew\u2019s feet; and beat his hands together, in perfect desperation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy\u2019s right,\u201d remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Oliver, you\u2019re right; they will think you have stolen \u2019em. Ha! ha!\u201d chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have happened better, if we had chosen our time!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it couldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cI know\u2019d that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm. It\u2019s all right enough. They\u2019re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn\u2019t have taken him in at all; and they\u2019ll ask no questions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged. He\u2019s safe enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the roof.\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep back the dog, Bill!\u201d cried Nancy, springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. \u201cKeep back the dog; he\u2019ll tear the boy to pieces.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cServe him right!\u201d cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl\u2019s grasp. \u201cStand off from me, or I\u2019ll split your head against the wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for that, Bill, I don\u2019t care for that,\u201d screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, \u201cthe child shan\u2019t be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShan\u2019t he!\u201d said Sikes, setting his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll soon do that, if you don\u2019t keep off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here!\u201d said Fagin, looking round.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe girl\u2019s gone mad, I think,\u201d replied Sikes, savagely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; \u201cno, she hasn\u2019t, Fagin; don\u2019t think it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen keep quiet, will you?\u201d said the Jew, with a threatening look.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t do that, neither,\u201d replied Nancy, speaking very loud. \u201cCome! What do you think of that?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her, at present. With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?\u201d said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; \u201ceh?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver made no reply. But he watched the Jew\u2019s motions, and breathed quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?\u201d sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll cure you of that, my young master.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver\u2019s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand. She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t stand by and see it done, Fagin,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the boy, and what more would you have?\u2014Let him be\u2014let him be\u2014or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before my time.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Nancy!\u201d said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner; \u201cyou,\u2014you\u2019re more clever than ever to-night. Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I!\u201d said the girl. \u201cTake care I don\u2019t overdo it. You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy\u2019s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: \u201cwhat do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know who you are, and what you are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I know all about it,\u201d replied the girl, laughing hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of indifference.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, keep quiet,\u201d rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, \u201cor I\u2019ll quiet you for a good long time to come.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the blood came.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a nice one,\u201d added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air, \u201cto take up the humane and gen\u2014teel side! A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod Almighty help me, I am!\u201d cried the girl passionately; \u201cand I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him here. He\u2019s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that\u2019s bad, from this night forth. Isn\u2019t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, come, Sikes,\u201d said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all that passed; \u201cwe must have civil words; civil words, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCivil words!\u201d cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see. \u201cCivil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve \u2019em from me. I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!\u201d pointing to Oliver. \u201cI have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since. Don\u2019t you know it? Speak out! Don\u2019t you know it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; \u201cand, if you have, it\u2019s your living!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAye, it is!\u201d returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream. \u201cIt is my living; and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you\u2019re the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that\u2019ll keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall do you a mischief!\u201d interposed the Jew, goaded by these reproaches; \u201ca mischief worse than that, if you say much more!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s all right now,\u201d said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. \u201cShe\u2019s uncommon strong in the arms, when she\u2019s up in this way.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst of having to do with women,\u201d said the Jew, replacing his club; \u201cbut they\u2019re clever, and we can\u2019t get on, in our line, without \u2019em. Charley, show Oliver to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he\u2019d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?\u201d inquired Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow\u2019s; and the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his whereabout.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut off the smart ones,\u201d said Charley, \u201cand I\u2019ll give \u2019em to Fagin to take care of. What fun it is!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the door behind him.\r\n\r\nThe noise of Charley\u2019s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed. But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nOLIVER\u2019S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION\r\n\r\nIt is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.\r\n\r\nSuch changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight. The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference. The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.\r\n\r\nAs sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author\u2019s skill in his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was higher than usual. There was an abstraction in his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle\u2019s mind, too great for utterance.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along. He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in his dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrat that beadle!\u201d said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at the garden-gate. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t him at this time in the morning! Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it is a pleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Mann,\u201d said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair; \u201cMrs. Mann, ma\u2019am, good morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and good morning to you, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann, with many smiles; \u201cand hoping you find yourself well, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo-so, Mrs. Mann,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cA porochial life is not a bed of roses, Mrs. Mann.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that it isn\u2019t indeed, Mr. Bumble,\u201d rejoined the lady. And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety, if they had heard it.\r\n\r\n\u201cA porochial life, ma\u2019am,\u201d continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table with his cane, \u201cis a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!\u201d said the beadle.\r\n\r\nFinding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Mann, I am going to London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLauk, Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo London, ma\u2019am,\u201d resumed the inflexible beadle, \u201cby coach. I and two paupers, Mrs. Mann! A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement; and the board has appointed me\u2014me, Mrs. Mann\u2014to dispose to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.\r\n\r\nAnd I very much question,\u201d added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up, \u201cwhether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you mustn\u2019t be too hard upon them, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble; \u201cand if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by them. At length she said,\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going by coach, sir? I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s when they\u2019re ill, Mrs. Mann,\u201d said the beadle. \u201cWe put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking cold.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThey are both in a very low state, and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move \u2019em than to bury \u2019em\u2014that is, if we can throw \u2019em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don\u2019t die upon the road to spite us. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the cocked hat; and he became grave.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are forgetting business, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the beadle; \u201chere is your porochial stipend for the month.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his pocket-book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much blotted, sir,\u201d said the farmer of infants; \u201cbut it\u2019s formal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much obliged to you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann\u2019s curtsey; and inquired how the children were.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless their dear little hearts!\u201d said Mrs. Mann with emotion, \u201cthey\u2019re as well as can be, the dears! Of course, except the two that died last week. And little Dick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that boy no better?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble angrily. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann. \u201cHere, you Dick!\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter some calling, Dick was discovered. Having had his face put under the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann\u2019s gown, he was led into the awful presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.\r\n\r\nThe child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large and bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man.\r\n\r\nSuch was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble\u2019s glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear the beadle\u2019s voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?\u201d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\nThe child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, porochial Dick?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble, with well-timed jocularity.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, sir,\u201d replied the child faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think not,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble\u2019s humour.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want for nothing, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like\u2014\u201d faltered the child.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey-day!\u201d interposed Mrs. Mann, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to say that you do want for something, now? Why, you little wretch\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, Mrs. Mann, stop!\u201d said the beadle, raising his hand with a show of authority. \u201cLike what, sir, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like,\u201d faltered the child, \u201cif somebody that can write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what does the boy mean?\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression: accustomed as he was to such things. \u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like,\u201d said the child, \u201cto leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him. And I should like to tell him,\u201d said the child pressing his small hands together, and speaking with great fervour, \u201cthat I was glad to die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, \u201cThey\u2019re all in one story, Mrs. Mann. That out-dacious Oliver had demogalized them all!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have believed it, sir\u201d said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. \u201cI never see such a hardened little wretch!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTake him away, ma\u2019am!\u201d said Mr. Bumble imperiously. \u201cThis must be stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope the gentleman will understand that it isn\u2019t my fault, sir?\u201d said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey shall understand that, ma\u2019am; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThere; take him away, I can\u2019t bear the sight on him.\u201d\r\n\r\nDick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar. Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.\r\n\r\nAt six o\u2019clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it: took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in London.\r\n\r\nHe experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.\r\n\r\nThe very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble\u2019s eye rested, was the following advertisement.\r\n\r\n\u201cFIVE GUINEAS REWARD\r\n\r\n\u201cWhereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since been heard of. The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then followed a full description of Oliver\u2019s dress, person, appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Mr. Brownlow at home?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door.\r\n\r\nTo this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive reply of \u201cI don\u2019t know; where do you come from?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver\u2019s name, in explanation of his errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d said the old lady: \u201cI knew we should hear of him. Poor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his heart! I said so all along.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did.\r\n\r\nHe was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them. The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:\r\n\r\n\u201cA beadle. A parish beadle, or I\u2019ll eat my head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray don\u2019t interrupt just now,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cTake a seat, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig\u2019s manner. Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle\u2019s countenance; and said, with a little impatience,\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you ARE a beadle, are you not?\u201d inquired Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, \u201cI knew he was. A beadle all over!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know where this poor boy is now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more than nobody,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what do you know of him?\u201d inquired the old gentleman. \u201cSpeak out, my friend, if you have anything to say. What do you know of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know any good of him, do you?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble\u2019s features.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with portentous solemnity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble\u2019s pursed-up countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver, in as few words as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms; inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments\u2019 reflection, commenced his story.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious if given in the beadle\u2019s words: occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents. That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice. That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from his master\u2019s house. In proof of his really being the person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow\u2019s observations.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear it is all too true,\u201d said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after looking over the papers. \u201cThis is not much for your intelligence; but I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable to the boy.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history. It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle\u2019s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him further.\r\n\r\nAt length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bedwin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; \u201cthat boy, Oliver, is an imposter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be, sir. It cannot be,\u201d said the old lady energetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you he is,\u201d retorted the old gentleman. \u201cWhat do you mean by can\u2019t be? We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never will believe it, sir,\u201d replied the old lady, firmly. \u201cNever!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying story-books,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig. \u201cI knew it all along. Why didn\u2019t you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn\u2019t had a fever, I suppose, eh? He was interesting, wasn\u2019t he? Interesting! Bah!\u201d And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,\u201d retorted Mrs. Bedwin, indignantly. \u201cI know what children are, sir; and have done these forty years; and people who can\u2019t say the same, shouldn\u2019t say anything about them. That\u2019s my opinion!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor. As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head, and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was stopped by Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from feeling. \u201cNever let me hear the boy\u2019s name again. I rang to tell you that. Never. Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin. Remember! I am in earnest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow\u2019s that night.\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken outright.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nHOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS\r\n\r\nAbout noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning. Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few select friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation.\r\n\r\nLittle Oliver\u2019s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew\u2019s words, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them. That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely, when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind. As he glanced timidly up, and met the Jew\u2019s searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they would be very good friends yet. Then, taking his hat, and covering himself with an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the room-door behind him.\r\n\r\nAnd so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts. Which, never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked; and he was at liberty to wander about the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dirty place. The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways. From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now.\r\n\r\nSpiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes. With these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned.\r\n\r\nIn all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows. There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends. Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver\u2019s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or heard,\u2014which he had as much chance of being, as if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet, straightway.\r\n\r\nOliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal. So he at once expressed his readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as \u201cjapanning his trotter-cases.\u201d The phrase, rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature. He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said, half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a pity it is he isn\u2019t a prig!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Master Charles Bates; \u201che don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates. They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t even know what a prig is?\u201d said the Dodger mournfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I know that,\u201d replied Oliver, looking up. \u201cIt\u2019s a the\u2014; you\u2019re one, are you not?\u201d inquired Oliver, checking himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d replied the Dodger. \u201cI\u2019d scorn to be anything else.\u201d Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d repeated the Dodger. \u201cSo\u2019s Charley. So\u2019s Fagin. So\u2019s Sikes. So\u2019s Nancy. So\u2019s Bet. So we all are, down to the dog. And he\u2019s the downiest one of the lot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the least given to peaching,\u201d added Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without wittles for a fortnight,\u201d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d observed Charley.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a rum dog. Don\u2019t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he\u2019s in company!\u201d pursued the Dodger. \u201cWon\u2019t he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing! And don\u2019t he hate other dogs as ain\u2019t of his breed! Oh, no!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s an out-and-out Christian,\u201d said Charley.\r\n\r\nThis was merely intended as a tribute to the animal\u2019s abilities, but it was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes\u2019 dog, there exist strong and singular points of resemblance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t got anything to do with young Green here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more it has,\u201d said Charley. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd make your fortun\u2019 out of hand?\u201d added the Dodger, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,\u201d said Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d rejoined Oliver, timidly; \u201cI wish they would let me go. I\u2014I\u2014would rather go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Fagin would rather not!\u201d rejoined Charley.\r\n\r\nOliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot-cleaning.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo!\u201d exclaimed the Dodger. \u201cWhy, where\u2019s your spirit? Don\u2019t you take any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, blow that!\u201d said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard, \u201cthat\u2019s too mean; that is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can leave your friends, though,\u201d said Oliver with a half smile; \u201cand let them be punished for what you did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, \u201cThat was all out of consideration for Fagin, \u2019cause the traps know that we work together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn\u2019t made our lucky; that was the move, wasn\u2019t it, Charley?\u201d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of Oliver\u2019s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes long.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here!\u201d said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence. \u201cHere\u2019s a jolly life! What\u2019s the odds where it comes from? Here, catch hold; there\u2019s plenty more where they were took from. You won\u2019t, won\u2019t you? Oh, you precious flat!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s naughty, ain\u2019t it, Oliver?\u201d inquired Charley Bates. \u201cHe\u2019ll come to be scragged, won\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething in this way, old feller,\u201d said Charly. As he said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it means,\u201d said Charley. \u201cLook how he stares, Jack! I never did see such prime company as that \u2019ere boy; he\u2019ll be the death of me, I know he will.\u201d Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been brought up bad,\u201d said the Dodger, surveying his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. \u201cFagin will make something of you, though, or you\u2019ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable. You\u2019d better begin at once; for you\u2019ll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you\u2019re only losing time, Oliver.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own: which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin\u2019s favour without more delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd always put this in your pipe, Nolly,\u201d said the Dodger, as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above, \u201cif you don\u2019t take fogels and tickers\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of talking in that way?\u201d interposed Master Bates; \u201che don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t take pocket-handkechers and watches,\u201d said the Dodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver\u2019s capacity, \u201csome other cove will; so that the coves that lose \u2019em will be all the worse, and you\u2019ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha\u2019p\u2019orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them\u2014and you\u2019ve just as good a right to them as they have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure, to be sure!\u201d said the Jew, who had entered unseen by Oliver. \u201cIt all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger\u2019s word for it. Ha! ha! ha! He understands the catechism of his trade.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the Dodger\u2019s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his pupil\u2019s proficiency.\r\n\r\nThe conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.\r\n\r\nMr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements. He had small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron. His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his \u201ctime\u201d was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes. Mr. Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the County. The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful. Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long hard-working days; and that he \u201cwished he might be busted if he warn\u2019t as dry as a lime-basket.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?\u201d inquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young friend of mine, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s in luck, then,\u201d said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin. \u201cNever mind where I came from, young \u2019un; you\u2019ll find your way there, soon enough, I\u2019ll bet a crown!\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this sally, the boys laughed. After some more jokes on the same subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.\r\n\r\nAfter some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers. These were, the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew himself. At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two. Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.\r\n\r\nFrom this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver\u2019s, Mr. Fagin best knew. At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings.\r\n\r\nIn short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils. Having prepared his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nIN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON\r\n\r\nIt was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den. He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he could.\r\n\r\nThe house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields.\r\n\r\nThe mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal.\r\n\r\nHe kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely-populated quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end. At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs.\r\n\r\nA dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man\u2019s voice demanded who was there.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly me, Bill; only me, my dear,\u201d said the Jew looking in.\r\n\r\n\u201cBring in your body then,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cLie down, you stupid brute! Don\u2019t you know the devil when he\u2019s got a great-coat on?\u201d\r\n\r\nApparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin\u2019s outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\u2014\u201cAh! Nancy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady\u2019s behaviour. She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is cold, Nancy dear,\u201d said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire. \u201cIt seems to go right through one,\u201d added the old man, touching his side.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,\u201d said Mr. Sikes. \u201cGive him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make haste! It\u2019s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.\u201d\r\n\r\nNancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids. Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,\u201d replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! You\u2019re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?\u201d inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. \u201cUgh!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he did at once.\r\n\r\nThe Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a \u201clife-preserver\u201d that hung over the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Sikes, smacking his lips. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor business?\u201d inquired the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor business,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cso say what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout the crib at Chertsey, Bill?\u201d said the Jew, drawing his chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Wot about it?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! you know what I mean, my dear,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cHe knows what I mean, Nancy; don\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he don\u2019t,\u201d sneered Mr. Sikes. \u201cOr he won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the same thing. Speak out, and call things by their right names; don\u2019t sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn\u2019t the very first that thought about the robbery. Wot d\u2019ye mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, Bill, hush!\u201d said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation; \u201csomebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody will hear us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet \u2019em hear!\u201d said Sikes; \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d But as Mr. Sikes did care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew calmer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d said the Jew, coaxingly. \u201cIt was only my caution, nothing more. Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh? When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such plate!\u201d said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Sikes coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to be done at all!\u201d echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d rejoined Sikes. \u201cAt least it can\u2019t be a put-up job, as we expected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it hasn\u2019t been properly gone about,\u201d said the Jew, turning pale with anger. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I will tell you,\u201d retorted Sikes. \u201cWho are you that\u2019s not to be told? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight, and he can\u2019t get one of the servants in line.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to tell me, Bill,\u201d said the Jew: softening as the other grew heated: \u201cthat neither of the two men in the house can be got over?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do mean to tell you so,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cThe old lady has had \u2019em these twenty years; and if you were to give \u2019em five hundred pound, they wouldn\u2019t be in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut do you mean to say, my dear,\u201d remonstrated the Jew, \u201cthat the women can\u2019t be got over?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot by flash Toby Crackit?\u201d said the Jew incredulously. \u201cThink what women are, Bill,\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; not even by flash Toby Crackit,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cHe says he\u2019s worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he\u2019s been loitering down there, and it\u2019s all of no use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my dear,\u201d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo he did,\u201d rejoined Sikes, \u201cand they warn\u2019t of no more use than the other plant.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew looked blank at this information. After ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared the game was up.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, \u201cit\u2019s a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is,\u201d said Mr. Sikes. \u201cWorse luck!\u201d\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal. Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time. Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin,\u201d said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed; \u201cis it worth fifty shiners extra, if it\u2019s safely done from the outside?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it a bargain?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my dear, yes,\u201d rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew\u2019s hand, with some disdain, \u201clet it come off as soon as you like. Toby and me were over the garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters. The crib\u2019s barred up at night like a jail; but there\u2019s one part we can crack, safe and softly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich is that, Bill?\u201d asked the Jew eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d whispered Sikes, \u201cas you cross the lawn\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost starting out of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cUmph!\u201d cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew\u2019s face. \u201cNever mind which part it is. You can\u2019t do it without me, I know; but it\u2019s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you like, my dear, as you like\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cIs there no help wanted, but yours and Toby\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cCept a centre-bit and a boy. The first we\u2019ve both got; the second you must find us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA boy!\u201d exclaimed the Jew. \u201cOh! then it\u2019s a panel, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind wot it is!\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cI want a boy, and he musn\u2019t be a big \u2019un. Lord!\u201d said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, \u201cif I\u2019d only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper\u2019s! He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job. But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a \u2019prentice of him. And so they go on,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, \u201cso they go on; and, if they\u2019d got money enough (which it\u2019s a Providence they haven\u2019t,) we shouldn\u2019t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more we should,\u201d acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. \u201cBill!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room. Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want any beer,\u201d said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining her seat very composedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you I do!\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d rejoined the girl coolly, \u201cGo on, Fagin. I know what he\u2019s going to say, Bill; he needn\u2019t mind me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew still hesitated. Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?\u201d he asked at length. \u201cYou\u2019ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil\u2019s in it. She ain\u2019t one to blab. Are you Nancy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think not!\u201d replied the young lady: drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear, I know you\u2019re not,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cbut\u2014\u201d and again the old man paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut wot?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether she mightn\u2019t p\u2019r\u2019aps be out of sorts, you know, my dear, as she was the other night,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\nAt this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of \u201cKeep the game a-going!\u201d \u201cNever say die!\u201d and the like. These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Fagin,\u201d said Nancy with a laugh. \u201cTell Bill at once, about Oliver!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! you\u2019re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!\u201d said the Jew, patting her on the neck. \u201cIt was about Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d demanded Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s the boy for you, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe!\u201d exclaimed Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave him, Bill!\u201d said Nancy. \u201cI would, if I was in your place. He mayn\u2019t be so much up, as any of the others; but that\u2019s not what you want, if he\u2019s only to open a door for you. Depend upon it he\u2019s a safe one, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know he is,\u201d rejoined Fagin. \u201cHe\u2019s been in good training these last few weeks, and it\u2019s time he began to work for his bread. Besides, the others are all too big.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he is just the size I want,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,\u201d interposed the Jew; \u201che can\u2019t help himself. That is, if you frighten him enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrighten him!\u201d echoed Sikes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be no sham frightening, mind you. If there\u2019s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound. You won\u2019t see him alive again, Fagin. Think of that, before you send him. Mark my words!\u201d said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it all,\u201d said the Jew with energy. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve had my eye upon him, my dears, close\u2014close. Once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and he\u2019s ours! Ours for his life. Oho! It couldn\u2019t have come about better!\u201d The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOurs!\u201d said Sikes. \u201cYours, you mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I do, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. \u201cMine, if you like, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd wot,\u201d said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, \u201cwot makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you might pick and choose from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re of no use to me, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, with some confusion, \u201cnot worth the taking. Their looks convict \u2019em when they get into trouble, and I lose \u2019em all. With this boy, properly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn\u2019t with twenty of them. Besides,\u201d said the Jew, recovering his self-possession, \u201che has us now if he could only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us. Never mind how he came there; it\u2019s quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery; that\u2019s all I want. Now, how much better this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way\u2014which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen is it to be done?\u201d asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he received Fagin\u2019s affectation of humanity.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, to be sure,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cwhen is it to be done, Bill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,\u201d rejoined Sikes in a surly voice, \u201cif he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cthere\u2019s no moon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d rejoined Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?\u201d asked the Jew.\r\n\r\nSikes nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd about\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, ah, it\u2019s all planned,\u201d rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. \u201cNever mind particulars. You\u2019d better bring the boy here to-morrow night. I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak. Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew\u2019s next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else. It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with wild execrations. At length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools: which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Nancy,\u201d said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no flinching about the girl. She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be.\r\n\r\nThe Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped downstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways the way!\u201d muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward. \u201cThe worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never lasts. Ha! ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!\u201d\r\n\r\nBeguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him,\u201d was his first remark as they descended the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cHours ago,\u201d replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. \u201cHere he is!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now,\u201d said the Jew, turning softly away. \u201cTo-morrow. To-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nWHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES\r\n\r\nWhen Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo\u2014to\u2014stop there, sir?\u201d asked Oliver, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear. Not to stop there,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t like to lose you. Don\u2019t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again. Ha! ha! ha! We won\u2019t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear. Oh no, no!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, \u201cyou want to know what you\u2019re going to Bill\u2019s for\u2014-eh, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, do you think?\u201d inquired Fagin, parrying the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed I don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy\u2019s face. \u201cWait till Bill tells you, then.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver\u2019s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin\u2019s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then. He had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may burn a candle,\u201d said the Jew, putting one upon the table. \u201cAnd here\u2019s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you. Good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night!\u201d replied Oliver, softly.\r\n\r\nThe Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.\r\n\r\nOliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light it. He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake heed, Oliver! take heed!\u201d said the old man, shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner. \u201cHe\u2019s a rough man, and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do what he bids you. Mind!\u201d Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room.\r\n\r\nOliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. The more he thought of the Jew\u2019s admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning.\r\n\r\nHe could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes, which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged. He was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely. He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him, began to read.\r\n\r\nHe turned over the leaves. Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume. It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony. Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think of. The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.\r\n\r\nIn a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him. Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt.\r\n\r\nHe had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that!\u201d he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing by the door. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMe. Only me,\u201d replied a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\nOliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door. It was Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut down the light,\u201d said the girl, turning away her head. \u201cIt hurts my eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill. The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung her hands; but made no reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod forgive me!\u201d she cried after a while, \u201cI never thought of this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas anything happened?\u201d asked Oliver. \u201cCan I help you? I will if I can. I will, indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling sound, gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cNancy!\u201d cried Oliver, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold.\r\n\r\nOliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what comes over me sometimes,\u201d said she, affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress; \u201cit\u2019s this damp dirty room, I think. Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I to go with you?\u201d asked Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I have come from Bill,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cYou are to go with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d asked Oliver, recoiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy\u2019s face. \u201cOh! For no harm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Oliver: who had watched her closely.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave it your own way,\u201d rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. \u201cFor no good, then.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver could see that he had some power over the girl\u2019s better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state. But, then, the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o\u2019clock; and that many people were still in the streets: of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale. As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward: and said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready.\r\n\r\nNeither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his companion. She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round. \u201cYou can\u2019t help yourself. I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nStruck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise. She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do now,\u201d continued the girl aloud; \u201cfor those who would have fetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me. I have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death. See here! I have borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and continued, with great rapidity:\r\n\r\n\u201cRemember this! And don\u2019t let me suffer more for you, just now. If I could help you, I would; but I have not the power. They don\u2019t mean to harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! Every word from you is a blow for me. Give me your hand. Make haste! Your hand!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had passed out. A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close. The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant.\r\n\r\nThe girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted. All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew\u2019s steps had been directed on the previous evening.\r\n\r\nFor one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl\u2019s voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was shut.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time. \u201cBill!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo!\u201d replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a candle. \u201cOh! That\u2019s the time of day. Come on!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes\u2019 temperament. Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.\r\n\r\n\u201cBull\u2019s-eye\u2019s gone home with Tom,\u201d observed Sikes, as he lighted them up. \u201cHe\u2019d have been in the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d rejoined Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve got the kid,\u201d said Sikes when they had all reached the room: closing the door as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, here he is,\u201d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he come quiet?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike a lamb,\u201d rejoined Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; \u201cfor the sake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it. Come here, young \u2019un; and let me read you a lectur\u2019, which is as well got over at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver\u2019s cap and threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, first: do you know wot this is?\u201d inquired Sikes, taking up a pocket-pistol which lay on the table.\r\n\r\nOliver replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, look here,\u201d continued Sikes. \u201cThis is powder; that \u2019ere\u2019s a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and deliberation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow it\u2019s loaded,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I see it is, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the robber, grasping Oliver\u2019s wrist, and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start; \u201cif you speak a word when you\u2019re out o\u2019doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without notice. So, if you do make up your mind to speak without leave, say your prayers first.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its effect, Mr. Sikes continued.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs near as I know, there isn\u2019t anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you, if you was disposed of; so I needn\u2019t take this devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn\u2019t for your own good. D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe short and the long of what you mean,\u201d said Nancy: speaking very emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words: \u201cis, that if you\u2019re crossed by him in this job you have on hand, you\u2019ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every month of your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; \u201cwomen can always put things in fewest words.\u2014Except when it\u2019s blowing up; and then they lengthens it out. And now that he\u2019s thoroughly up to it, let\u2019s have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep\u2019s heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of \u201cjemmies\u201d being a can name, common to them, and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession. Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.\r\n\r\nSupper being ended\u2014it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it\u2014Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely. Oliver stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim the light. Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which hung over the back of a chair. Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast. It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then!\u201d growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; \u201chalf-past five! Look sharp, or you\u2019ll get no breakfast; for it\u2019s late as it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast, he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite ready.\r\n\r\nNancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders. Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.\r\n\r\nOliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE EXPEDITION\r\n\r\nIt was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were overflowing. There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops, and dreary streets. There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were noiseless and empty.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had fairly begun to break. Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time. The public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open. By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with. Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads; donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town. As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle. It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun.\r\n\r\nTurning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.\r\n\r\nIt was market-morning. The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above. All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep. Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded the senses.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy. He nodded, twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, young \u2019un!\u201d said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew\u2019s Church, \u201chard upon seven! you must step out. Come, don\u2019t lag behind already, Lazy-legs!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion\u2019s wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as he could.\r\n\r\nThey held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park corner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up. Seeing \u201cHounslow\u201d written on it, he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth.\r\n\r\n\u201cJump up,\u201d said the man. \u201cIs that your boy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; he\u2019s my boy,\u201d replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father walks rather too quick for you, don\u2019t he, my man?\u201d inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Sikes, interposing. \u201cHe\u2019s used to it. Here, take hold of my hand, Ned. In with you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver, pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where his companion meant to take him. Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey. At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off. And here, the cart stopped.\r\n\r\nSikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look upon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, boy,\u201d said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s sulky,\u201d replied Sikes, giving him a shake; \u201che\u2019s sulky. A young dog! Don\u2019t mind him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot I!\u201d rejoined the other, getting into his cart. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine day, after all.\u201d And he drove away.\r\n\r\nSikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his journey.\r\n\r\nThey turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen\u2019s houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town. Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters, \u201cHampton.\u201d They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours. At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking and smoking. They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their company.\r\n\r\nThey had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further. Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of ale.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the man, who seemed a little the worse\u2014or better, as the case might be\u2014for drinking; \u201cand not slow about it neither. My horse hasn\u2019t got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in the mornin\u2019; and he won\u2019t be long a-doing of it. Here\u2019s luck to him. Ecod! he\u2019s a good \u2019un!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?\u201d demanded Sikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going directly, I can,\u201d replied the man, looking out of the pot. \u201cAre you going to Halliford?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing on to Shepperton,\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m your man, as far as I go,\u201d replied the other. \u201cIs all paid, Becky?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the other gentleman\u2019s paid,\u201d replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say!\u201d said the man, with tipsy gravity; \u201cthat won\u2019t do, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d rejoined Sikes. \u201cYou\u2019re a-going to accommodate us, and wot\u2019s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face; having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real good fellow. To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.\r\n\r\nAfter the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see the party start.\r\n\r\nThe horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing outside: ready harnessed to the cart. Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two \u201cto bear him up,\u201d and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal, mounted also. Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs, he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right gallantly.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark. A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation. Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.\r\n\r\nAs they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. There was a light in the ferry-house window opposite: which streamed across the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it. There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind. It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead.\r\n\r\nSunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road. Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.\r\n\r\nThey turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance. On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge.\r\n\r\nSikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe water!\u201d thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. \u201cHe has brought me to this lonely place to murder me!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house: all ruinous and decayed. There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible. The house was dark, dismantled: and, to all appearance, uninhabited.\r\n\r\nSikes, with Oliver\u2019s hand still in his, softly approached the low porch, and raised the latch. The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in together.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE BURGLARY\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo!\u201d cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the passage.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make such a row,\u201d said Sikes, bolting the door. \u201cShow a glim, Toby.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha! my pal!\u201d cried the same voice. \u201cA glim, Barney, a glim! Show the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear?\u201d cried the same voice. \u201cThere\u2019s Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?\u201d\r\n\r\nA pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill.\r\n\r\n\u201cBister Sikes!\u201d exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; \u201ccub id, sir; cub id.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere! you get on first,\u201d said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him. \u201cQuicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.\u201d\r\n\r\nMuttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe. He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches. Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common rings. He was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cBill, my boy!\u201d said this figure, turning his head towards the door, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you\u2019d given it up: in which case I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!\u201d\r\n\r\nUttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded who that was.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy. Only the boy!\u201d replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cWud of Bister Fagid\u2019s lads,\u201d exclaimed Barney, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin\u2019s, eh!\u201d exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. \u201cWot an inwalable boy that\u2019ll make, for the old ladies\u2019 pockets in chapels! His mug is a fortin\u2019 to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2014there\u2019s enough of that,\u201d interposed Sikes, impatiently; and stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his ear: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, \u201cif you\u2019ll give us something to eat and drink while we\u2019re waiting, you\u2019ll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events. Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you\u2019ll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far off.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing where he was, or what was passing around him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a bottle upon the table, \u201cSuccess to the crack!\u201d He rose to honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents. Mr. Sikes did the same.\r\n\r\n\u201cA drain for the boy,\u201d said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. \u201cDown with it, innocence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man\u2019s face; \u201cindeed, I\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDown with it!\u201d echoed Toby. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had better!\u201d said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. \u201cBurn my body, if he isn\u2019t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!\u201d\r\n\r\nFrightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.\r\n\r\nThis done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap. Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor: close outside the fender.\r\n\r\nThey slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day: when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged in busy preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he hastily crammed into the pockets.\r\n\r\n\u201cBarkers for me, Barney,\u201d said Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere they are,\u201d replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. \u201cYou loaded them yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right!\u201d replied Toby, stowing them away. \u201cThe persuaders?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got \u2019em,\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cCrape, keys, centre-bits, darkies\u2014nothing forgotten?\u201d inquired Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d rejoined his companion. \u201cBring them bits of timber, Barney. That\u2019s the time of day.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he took a thick stick from Barney\u2019s hands, who, having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver\u2019s cape.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then!\u201d said Sikes, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\nOliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake his other hand, Toby,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cLook out, Barney.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet. The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.\r\n\r\nIt was now intensely dark. The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver\u2019s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about. They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before. They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.\r\n\r\n\u201cSlap through the town,\u201d whispered Sikes; \u201cthere\u2019ll be nobody in the way, to-night, to see us.\u201d\r\n\r\nToby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night. But there was nobody abroad. They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two.\r\n\r\nQuickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy next,\u201d said Toby. \u201cHoist him up; I\u2019ll catch hold of him.\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously towards the house.\r\n\r\nAnd now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition. He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet up!\u201d murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from his pocket; \u201cGet up, or I\u2019ll strew your brains upon the grass.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! for God\u2019s sake let me go!\u201d cried Oliver; \u201clet me run away and die in the fields. I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal. For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the boy\u2019s mouth, and dragged him to the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d cried the man; \u201cit won\u2019t answer here. Say another word, and I\u2019ll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench the shutter open. He\u2019s game enough now, I\u2019ll engage. I\u2019ve seen older hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.\u201d\r\n\r\nSikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin\u2019s head for sending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise. After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he had referred, swung open on its hinges.\r\n\r\nIt was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing-place, at the end of the passage. The aperture was so small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver\u2019s size, nevertheless. A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike\u2019s art, sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow listen, you young limb,\u201d whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver\u2019s face; \u201cI\u2019m a going to put you through there. Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bolt at the top, you won\u2019t be able to reach,\u201d interposed Toby. \u201cStand upon one of the hall chairs. There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on \u2019em: which is the old lady\u2019s arms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep quiet, can\u2019t you?\u201d replied Sikes, with a threatening look. \u201cThe room-door is open, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWide,\u201d replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. \u201cThe game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who\u2019s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful. Ha! ha! Barney \u2019ticed him away to-night. So neat!\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to work. Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake this lantern,\u201d said Sikes, looking into the room. \u201cYou see the stairs afore you?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, \u201cYes.\u201d Sikes, pointing to the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would fall dead that instant.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s done in a minute,\u201d said Sikes, in the same low whisper. \u201cDirectly I leave go of you, do your work. Hark!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d whispered the other man.\r\n\r\nThey listened intently.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver. \u201cNow!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome back!\u201d suddenly cried Sikes aloud. \u201cBack! back!\u201d\r\n\r\nScared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly.\r\n\r\nThe cry was repeated\u2014a light appeared\u2014a vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes\u2014a flash\u2014a loud noise\u2014a smoke\u2014a crash somewhere, but where he knew not,\u2014and he staggered back.\r\n\r\nSikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up.\r\n\r\n\u201cClasp your arm tighter,\u201d said Sikes, as he drew him through the window. \u201cGive me a shawl here. They\u2019ve hit him. Quick! How the boy bleeds!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace. And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy\u2019s heart; and he saw or heard no more.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nWHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS\r\n\r\nThe night was bitter cold. The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which, as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air. Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die. Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly open them in a more bitter world.\r\n\r\nSuch was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round table: on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy. In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea. As she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently increased,\u2014so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking reflectively at the fire; \u201cI\u2019m sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.\r\n\r\nHow slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrat the pot!\u201d said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on the hob; \u201ca little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups! What use is it of, to anybody! Except,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, pausing, \u201cexcept to a poor desolate creature like me. Oh dear!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate. The small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years); and she was overpowered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never get another!\u201d said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; \u201cI shall never get another\u2014like him.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is uncertain. It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards. She had just tasted her first cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come in with you!\u201d said Mrs. Corney, sharply. \u201cSome of the old women dying, I suppose. They always die when I\u2019m at meals. Don\u2019t stand there, letting the cold air in, don\u2019t. What\u2019s amiss now, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, ma\u2019am, nothing,\u201d replied a man\u2019s voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, \u201cis that Mr. Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt your service, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other. \u201cShall I shut the door, ma\u2019am?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors. Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it without permission.\r\n\r\n\u201cHard weather, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cHard, indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cAnti-porochial weather this, ma\u2019am. We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not. When would they be, Mr. Bumble?\u201d said the matron, sipping her tea.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen, indeed, ma\u2019am!\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble. \u201cWhy here\u2019s one man that, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight. Is he grateful, ma\u2019am? Is he grateful? Not a copper farthing\u2019s worth of it! What does he do, ma\u2019am, but ask for a few coals; if it\u2019s only a pocket handkerchief full, he says! Coals! What would he do with coals? Toast his cheese with \u2019em and then come back for more. That\u2019s the way with these people, ma\u2019am; give \u2019em a apron full of coals to-day, and they\u2019ll come back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile; and the beadle went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201csee anything like the pitch it\u2019s got to. The day afore yesterday, a man\u2014you have been a married woman, ma\u2019am, and I may mention it to you\u2014a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer\u2019s door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney. As he wouldn\u2019t go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal. \u2018My heart!\u2019 says the ungrateful villain, \u2018what\u2019s the use of this to me? You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!\u2019 \u2018Very good,\u2019 says our overseer, taking \u2019em away again, \u2018you won\u2019t get anything else here.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll die in the streets!\u2019 says the vagrant. \u2018Oh no, you won\u2019t,\u2019 says our overseer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d interposed the matron. \u201cWell, Mr. Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined the beadle, \u201che went away; and he did die in the streets. There\u2019s a obstinate pauper for you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt beats anything I could have believed,\u201d observed the matron emphatically. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing, any way, Mr. Bumble? You\u2019re a gentleman of experience, and ought to know. Come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Corney,\u201d said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information, \u201cout-of-door relief, properly managed: properly managed, ma\u2019am: is the porochial safeguard. The great principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don\u2019t want; and then they get tired of coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Corney. \u201cWell, that is a good one, too!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Betwixt you and me, ma\u2019am,\u201d returned Mr. Bumble, \u201cthat\u2019s the great principle; and that\u2019s the reason why, if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you\u2019ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese. That\u2019s the rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,\u201d said the beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, \u201cthese are official secrets, ma\u2019am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma\u2019am, that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt blows, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar, \u201cenough to cut one\u2019s ears off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether\u2014whether he wouldn\u2019t take a cup of tea?\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. As he slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady. She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot. Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea. Again Mr. Bumble coughed\u2014louder this time than he had coughed yet.\r\n\r\n\u201cSweet? Mr. Bumble?\u201d inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sweet, indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe tea was made, and handed in silence. Mr. Bumble, having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a cat, ma\u2019am, I see,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who, in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; \u201cand kittens too, I declare!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can\u2019t think,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cThey\u2019re so happy, so frolicsome, and so cheerful, that they are quite companions for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery nice animals, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; \u201cso very domestic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; \u201cso fond of their home too, that it\u2019s quite a pleasure, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Corney, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time with his teaspoon, \u201cI mean to say this, ma\u2019am; that any cat, or kitten, that could live with you, ma\u2019am, and not be fond of its home, must be a ass, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Bumble!\u201d remonstrated Mrs. Corney.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s of no use disguising facts, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive; \u201cI would drown it myself, with pleasure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019re a cruel man,\u201d said the matron vivaciously, as she held out her hand for the beadle\u2019s cup; \u201cand a very hard-hearted man besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHard-hearted, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cHard?\u201d Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney\u2019s little finger as she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble\u2019s part: he being in some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings, which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all.\r\n\r\nWhatever were Mr. Bumble\u2019s intentions, however (and no doubt they were of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble stopped.\r\n\r\nNow, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen into Mr. Bumble\u2019s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was, and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\u201cHard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and looking up into the matron\u2019s face; \u201care you hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed the matron, \u201cwhat a very curious question from a single man. What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Bumble!\u201d cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, \u201cMr. Bumble, I shall scream!\u201d Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his arm round the matron\u2019s waist.\r\n\r\nAs the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting them with great violence: while the matron sharply demanded who was there.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, mistress,\u201d said a withered old female pauper, hideously ugly: putting her head in at the door, \u201cOld Sally is a-going fast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s that to me?\u201d angrily demanded the matron. \u201cI can\u2019t keep her alive, can I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, mistress,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cnobody can; she\u2019s far beyond the reach of help. I\u2019ve seen a many people die; little babes and great strong men; and I know when death\u2019s a-coming, well enough. But she\u2019s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,\u2014and that\u2019s not often, for she is dying very hard,\u2014she says she has got something to tell, which you must hear. She\u2019ll never die quiet till you come, mistress.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldn\u2019t even die without purposely annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back, lest anything particular should occur. Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble\u2019s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable. He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs, closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\nIt was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the matron\u2019s room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\nAlas! How few of Nature\u2019s faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven\u2019s surface clear. It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin\u2019s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay.\r\n\r\nIt was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end. There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary\u2019s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill.\r\n\r\n\u201cCold night, Mrs. Corney,\u201d said this young gentleman, as the matron entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery cold, indeed, sir,\u201d replied the mistress, in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should get better coals out of your contractors,\u201d said the apothecary\u2019s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker; \u201cthese are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re the board\u2019s choosing, sir,\u201d returned the matron. \u201cThe least they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said the young man, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient, \u201cit\u2019s all U.P. there, Mrs. Corney.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, is it, sir?\u201d asked the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,\u201d said the apothecary\u2019s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick\u2019s point. \u201cIt\u2019s a break-up of the system altogether. Is she dozing, old lady?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps she\u2019ll go off in that way, if you don\u2019t make a row,\u201d said the young man. \u201cPut the light on the floor. She won\u2019t see it there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned. The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\nThe apothecary\u2019s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.\r\n\r\nWhen they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to catch the heat. The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?\u201d inquired the messenger.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word,\u201d replied the other. \u201cShe plucked and tore at her arms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. She hasn\u2019t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet. I ain\u2019t so weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?\u201d demanded the first.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tried to get it down,\u201d rejoined the other. \u201cBut her teeth were tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again. So I drank it; and it did me good!\u201d\r\n\r\nLooking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI mind the time,\u201d said the first speaker, \u201cwhen she would have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, that she would,\u201d rejoined the other; \u201cshe had a merry heart. A many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as waxwork. My old eyes have seen them\u2014ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.\u201d\r\n\r\nStretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket, brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few more into her own. While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait?\r\n\r\n\u201cNot long, mistress,\u201d replied the second woman, looking up into her face. \u201cWe have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience! He\u2019ll be here soon enough for us all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, you doting idiot!\u201d said the matron sternly. \u201cYou, Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOften,\u201d answered the first woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut will never be again,\u201d added the second one; \u201cthat is, she\u2019ll never wake again but once\u2014and mind, mistress, that won\u2019t be for long!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLong or short,\u201d said the matron, snappishly, \u201cshe won\u2019t find me here when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing. It\u2019s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die, and I won\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s more. Mind that, you impudent old harridans. If you make a fool of me again, I\u2019ll soon cure you, I warrant you!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards the bed, caused her to look round. The patient had raised herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she cried, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, hush!\u201d said one of the women, stooping over her. \u201cLie down, lie down!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll never lie down again alive!\u201d said the woman, struggling. \u201cI will tell her! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in your ear.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.\r\n\r\n\u201cTurn them away,\u201d said the woman, drowsily; \u201cmake haste! make haste!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the bedside. On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old ladies themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow listen to me,\u201d said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy. \u201cIn this very room\u2014in this very bed\u2014I once nursed a pretty young creetur\u2019, that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled with dust and blood. She gave birth to a boy, and died. Let me think\u2014what was the year again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind the year,\u201d said the impatient auditor; \u201cwhat about her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy,\u201d murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state, \u201cwhat about her?\u2014what about\u2014I know!\u201d she cried, jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head\u2014\u201cI robbed her, so I did! She wasn\u2019t cold\u2014I tell you she wasn\u2019t cold, when I stole it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStole what, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d cried the matron, with a gesture as if she would call for help.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt!\u201d replied the woman, laying her hand over the other\u2019s mouth. \u201cThe only thing she had. She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom. It was gold, I tell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGold!\u201d echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back. \u201cGo on, go on\u2014yes\u2014what of it? Who was the mother? When was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe charged me to keep it safe,\u201d replied the woman with a groan, \u201cand trusted me as the only woman about her. I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child\u2019s death, perhaps, is on me besides! They would have treated him better, if they had known it all!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKnown what?\u201d asked the other. \u201cSpeak!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy grew so like his mother,\u201d said the woman, rambling on, and not heeding the question, \u201cthat I could never forget it when I saw his face. Poor girl! poor girl! She was so young, too! Such a gentle lamb! Wait; there\u2019s more to tell. I have not told you all, have I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as they came more faintly from the dying woman. \u201cBe quick, or it may be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe mother,\u201d said the woman, making a more violent effort than before; \u201cthe mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named. \u2018And oh, kind Heaven!\u2019 she said, folding her thin hands together, \u2018whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy\u2019s name?\u201d demanded the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey called him Oliver,\u201d replied the woman, feebly. \u201cThe gold I stole was\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes\u2014what?\u201d cried the other.\r\n\r\nShe was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cStone dead!\u201d said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the door was opened.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd nothing to tell, after all,\u201d rejoined the matron, walking carelessly away.\r\n\r\nThe two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering about the body.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nWHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY\r\n\r\nWhile these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old den\u2014the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl\u2014brooding over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.\r\n\r\nAt a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling\u2019s hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour\u2019s cards. It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors. He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be \u201cblowed,\u201d or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling. It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s two doubles and the rub,\u201d said Mr. Chitling, with a very long face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket. \u201cI never see such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything. Even when we\u2019ve good cards, Charley and I can\u2019t make nothing of \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nEither the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cMatter, Fagin!\u201d cried Charley. \u201cI wish you had watched the play. Tommy Chitling hasn\u2019t won a point; and I went partners with him against the Artfull and dumb.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, ay!\u201d said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason. \u201cTry \u2019em again, Tom; try \u2019em again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more of it for me, thank \u2019ee, Fagin,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling; \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. That \u2019ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there\u2019s no standing again\u2019 him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha! my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, \u201cyou must get up very early in the morning, to win against the Dodger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMorning!\u201d said Charley Bates; \u201cyou must put your boots on over-night, and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your shoulders, if you want to come over him.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture-card, at a shilling at a time. Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow precious dull you are, Tommy!\u201d said the Dodger, stopping short when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s thinking of, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow should I know, my dear?\u201d replied the Jew, looking round as he plied the bellows. \u201cAbout his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the country that he\u2019s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that it, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. \u201cWhat do you say, Charley?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say,\u201d replied Master Bates, with a grin, \u201cthat he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy. See how he\u2019s a-blushing! Oh, my eye! here\u2019s a merry-go-rounder! Tommy Chitling\u2019s in love! Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a spree!\u201d\r\n\r\nThoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind him, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows. \u201cBetsy\u2019s a fine girl. Stick up to her, Tom. Stick up to her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I mean to say, Fagin,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face, \u201cis, that that isn\u2019t anything to anybody here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more it is,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cCharley will talk. Don\u2019t mind him, my dear; don\u2019t mind him. Betsy\u2019s a fine girl. Do as she bids you, Tom, and you will make your fortune.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I do do as she bids me,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling; \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been milled, if it hadn\u2019t been for her advice. But it turned out a good job for you; didn\u2019t it, Fagin! And what\u2019s six weeks of it? It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don\u2019t want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, to be sure, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind it again, Tom, would you,\u201d asked the Dodger, winking upon Charley and the Jew, \u201cif Bet was all right?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean to say that I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Tom, angrily. \u201cThere, now. Ah! Who\u2019ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cnot a soul, Tom. I don\u2019t know one of \u2019em that would do it besides you; not one of \u2019em, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI might have got clear off, if I\u2019d split upon her; mightn\u2019t I, Fagin?\u201d angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. \u201cA word from me would have done it; wouldn\u2019t it, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure it would, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t blab it; did I, Fagin?\u201d demanded Tom, pouring question upon question with great volubility.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, to be sure,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cyou were too stout-hearted for that. A deal too stout, my dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I was,\u201d rejoined Tom, looking round; \u201cand if I was, what\u2019s to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.\r\n\r\n\u201cHark!\u201d cried the Dodger at this moment, \u201cI heard the tinkler.\u201d Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness. After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, \u201calone?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that he had better not be funny just then. Having performed this friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew\u2019s face, and awaited his directions.\r\n\r\nThe old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and feared to know the worst. At length he raised his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; \u201cbring him down. Hush! Quiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was softly and immediately obeyed. There was no sound of their whereabout, when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand, and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you, Faguey?\u201d said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. \u201cPop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that\u2019s the time of day! You\u2019ll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee there, Faguey,\u201d he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots; \u201cnot a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of blacking, by Jove! But don\u2019t look at me in that way, man. All in good time. I can\u2019t talk about business till I\u2019ve eat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let\u2019s have a quiet fill-out for the first time these three days!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his leisure.\r\n\r\nTo judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation. At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought; but in vain.\r\n\r\nHe looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement. It was all of no use. Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\u201d said Toby.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye, he quietly resumed.\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\u201d said the housebreaker, \u201chow\u2019s Bill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mean to say\u2014\u201d began Toby, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cMean!\u201d cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. \u201cWhere are they? Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where are they hiding? Why have they not been here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe crack failed,\u201d said Toby faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it,\u201d replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it. \u201cWhat more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with him between us\u2014straight as the crow flies\u2014through hedge and ditch. They gave chase. Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows! We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or dead, that\u2019s all I know about him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nIN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED\r\n\r\nThe old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit\u2019s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger: drove him back upon the pavement. Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at length emerged on Snow Hill. Here he walked even faster than before; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.\r\n\r\nNear to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill. In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets. Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse. It is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny: visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants, who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they come. Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant, display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.\r\n\r\nIt was into this place that the Jew turned. He was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a child\u2019s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!\u201d said this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew\u2019s inquiry after his health.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,\u201d said Fagin, elevating his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,\u201d replied the trader; \u201cbut it soon cools down again; don\u2019t you find it so?\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the Cripples?\u201d inquired the man.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d pursued the merchant, reflecting. \u201cYes, there\u2019s some half-dozen of \u2019em gone in, that I knows. I don\u2019t think your friend\u2019s there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSikes is not, I suppose?\u201d inquired the Jew, with a disappointed countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cNon istwentus, as the lawyers say,\u201d replied the little man, shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly. \u201cHave you got anything in my line to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing to-night,\u201d said the Jew, turning away.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?\u201d cried the little man, calling after him. \u201cStop! I don\u2019t mind if I have a drop there with you!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively\u2019s presence. By the time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.\r\n\r\nThe Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured. Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person.\r\n\r\nThe room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded red, from being visible outside. The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more. By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose, and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner.\r\n\r\nAs Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could. When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the chairman\u2019s right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group. There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was said\u2014and sharp ones, too. Near him were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very repulsiveness. Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked: others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.\r\n\r\nFagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?\u201d inquired the man, as he followed him out to the landing. \u201cWon\u2019t you join us? They\u2019ll be delighted, every one of \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, \u201cIs he here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd no news of Barney?\u201d inquired Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone,\u201d replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. \u201cHe won\u2019t stir till it\u2019s all safe. Depend on it, they\u2019re on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he\u2019d blow upon the thing at once. He\u2019s all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him. I\u2019ll pound it, that Barney\u2019s managing properly. Let him alone for that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill he be here to-night?\u201d asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonks, do you mean?\u201d inquired the landlord, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertain,\u201d replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; \u201cI expected him here before now. If you\u2019ll wait ten minutes, he\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his absence. \u201cTell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me to-night. No, say to-morrow. As he is not here, to-morrow will be time enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d said the man. \u201cNothing more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word now,\u201d said the Jew, descending the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a hoarse whisper; \u201cwhat a time this would be for a sell! I\u2019ve got Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! But it\u2019s not Phil Barker\u2019s time,\u201d said the Jew, looking up. \u201cPhil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives\u2014while they last. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe landlord reciprocated the old man\u2019s laugh; and returned to his guests. The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought. After a brief reflection, he called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green. He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes\u2019s residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, \u201cif there is any deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was in her room, the woman said. Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has been drinking,\u201d thought the Jew, cooly, \u201cor perhaps she is only miserable.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the noise thus occasioned, roused the girl. She eyed his crafty face narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit\u2019s story. When it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a word. She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all.\r\n\r\nDuring the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned. Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone. At length he made another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most conciliatory tone,\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd where should you think Bill was now, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be crying.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the boy, too,\u201d said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face. \u201cPoor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe child,\u201d said the girl, suddenly looking up, \u201cis better where he is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, I do,\u201d returned the girl, meeting his gaze. \u201cI shall be glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. I can\u2019t bear to have him about me. The sight of him turns me against myself, and all of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh!\u201d said the Jew, scornfully. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I?\u201d cried the girl bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s no fault of yours, if I am not! You\u2019d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except now;\u2014the humour doesn\u2019t suit you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d rejoined the Jew, furiously. \u201cIt does not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cChange it, then!\u201d responded the girl, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cChange it!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion\u2019s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, \u201cI will change it! Listen to me, you drab. Listen to me, who with six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull\u2019s throat between my fingers now. If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch. And do it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d cried the girl involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d pursued Fagin, mad with rage. \u201cWhen the boy\u2019s worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of! And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants the will, and has the power to, to\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPanting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole demeanour. A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy. After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion. He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNancy, dear!\u201d croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. \u201cDid you mind me, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry me now, Fagin!\u201d replied the girl, raising her head languidly. \u201cIf Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can\u2019t he won\u2019t; so no more about that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRegarding this boy, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy must take his chance with the rest,\u201d interrupted Nancy, hastily; \u201cand I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm\u2019s way, and out of yours,\u2014that is, if Bill comes to no harm. And if Toby got clear off, Bill\u2019s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill\u2019s worth two of Toby any time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd about what I was saying, my dear?\u201d observed the Jew, keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must say it all over again, if it\u2019s anything you want me to do,\u201d rejoined Nancy; \u201cand if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow. You put me up for a minute; but now I\u2019m stupid again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed. Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew\u2019s female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than checked. Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew\u2019s supposition; and when, after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of \u201cNever say die!\u201d and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed.\r\n\r\nHaving eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard, and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon the table.\r\n\r\nIt was within an hour of midnight. The weather being dark, and piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter. The sharp wind that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived.\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin!\u201d whispered a voice close to his ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the Jew, turning quickly round, \u201cis that\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d interrupted the stranger. \u201cI have been lingering here these two hours. Where the devil have you been?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn your business, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. \u201cOn your business all night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, of course!\u201d said the stranger, with a sneer. \u201cWell; and what\u2019s come of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing good,\u201d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing bad, I hope?\u201d said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a startled look on his companion.\r\n\r\nThe Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this time arrived: remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say, under cover: for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and the wind blew through him.\r\n\r\nFagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as dark as the grave,\u201d said the man, groping forward a few steps. \u201cMake haste!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShut the door,\u201d whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my doing,\u201d said the other man, feeling his way. \u201cThe wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. After a short absence, he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one. Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way upstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can say the few words we\u2019ve got to say in here, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; \u201cand as there are holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we\u2019ll set the candle on the stairs. There!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. This done, he led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind the door. Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face. It was not quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nThey conversed for some time in whispers. Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation. They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks\u2014by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy\u2014said, raising his voice a little,\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you again, it was badly planned. Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly hear him!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, do you mean to say you couldn\u2019t have done it, if you had chosen?\u201d demanded Monks, sternly. \u201cHaven\u2019t you done it, with other boys, scores of times? If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn\u2019t you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose turn would that have served, my dear?\u201d inquired the Jew humbly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMine,\u201d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not mine,\u201d said the Jew, submissively. \u201cHe might have become of use to me. When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw it was not easy to train him to the business,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201che was not like other boys in the same circumstances.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCurse him, no!\u201d muttered the man, \u201cor he would have been a thief, long ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no hold upon him to make him worse,\u201d pursued the Jew, anxiously watching the countenance of his companion. \u201cHis hand was not in. I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning, or we labour in vain. What could I do? Send him out with the Dodger and Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was not my doing,\u201d observed Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear!\u201d renewed the Jew. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t quarrel with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for. Well! I got him back for you by means of the girl; and then she begins to favour him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThrottle the girl!\u201d said Monks, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, we can\u2019t afford to do that just now, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, smiling; \u201cand, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done. I know what these girls are, Monks, well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she\u2019ll care no more for him, than for a block of wood. You want him made a thief. If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if\u2014if\u2014\u201d said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,\u2014\u201cit\u2019s not likely, mind,\u2014but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no fault of mine if he is!\u201d interposed the other man, with a look of terror, and clasping the Jew\u2019s arm with trembling hands. \u201cMind that. Fagin! I had no hand in it. Anything but his death, I told you from the first. I won\u2019t shed blood; it\u2019s always found out, and haunts a man besides. If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me? Fire this infernal den! What\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms, as he sprung to his feet. \u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYonder!\u201d replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. \u201cThe shadow! I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the wainscot like a breath!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room. The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed. It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces. They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fancy,\u201d said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll swear I saw it!\u201d replied Monks, trembling. \u201cIt was bending forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and, telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs. They looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty. They descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below. The green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think now?\u201d said the Jew, when they had regained the passage. \u201cBesides ourselves, there\u2019s not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys; and they\u2019re safe enough. See here!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.\r\n\r\nThis accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination. He declined any renewal of the conversation, however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was past one o\u2019clock. And so the amiable couple parted.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY\r\n\r\nAs it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words\u2014trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated\u2014hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands. Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies\u2019 beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney\u2019s approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney\u2019s chest of drawers.\r\n\r\nHaving listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction. Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.\r\n\r\nHe was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Corney,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, \u201cwhat is this, ma\u2019am? Has anything happened, ma\u2019am? Pray answer me: I\u2019m on\u2014on\u2014\u201d Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word \u201ctenterhooks,\u201d so he said \u201cbroken bottles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried the lady, \u201cI have been so dreadfully put out!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPut out, ma\u2019am!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble; \u201cwho has dared to\u2014? I know!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, \u201cthis is them wicious paupers!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s dreadful to think of!\u201d said the lady, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t think of it, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d whimpered the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen take something, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble soothingly. \u201cA little of the wine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for the world!\u201d replied Mrs. Corney. \u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u2014oh! The top shelf in the right-hand corner\u2014oh!\u201d Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms. Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady\u2019s lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m better now,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeppermint,\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke. \u201cTry it! There\u2019s a little\u2014a little something else in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very comforting,\u201d said Mrs. Corney.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the beadle. As he spoke, he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney. \u201cI am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot weak, ma\u2019am,\u201d retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little closer. \u201cAre you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are all weak creeturs,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general principle.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo we are,\u201d said the beadle.\r\n\r\nNothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney\u2019s chair, where it had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney\u2019s apron-string, round which it gradually became entwined.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are all weak creeturs,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t sigh, Mrs. Corney,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Mrs. Corney. And she sighed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very comfortable room, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble looking round. \u201cAnother room, and this, ma\u2019am, would be a complete thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be too much for one,\u201d murmured the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not for two, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. \u201cEh, Mrs. Corney?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney\u2019s face. Mrs. Corney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe board allows you coals, don\u2019t they, Mrs. Corney?\u201d inquired the beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd candles,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoals, candles, and house-rent free,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cOh, Mrs. Corney, what an Angel you are!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady was not proof against this burst of feeling. She sank into Mr. Bumble\u2019s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch porochial perfection!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. \u201cYou know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t live a week, the doctor says,\u201d pursued Mr. Bumble. \u201cHe is the master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that wacancy must be filled up. Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens! What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney sobbed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe little word?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty. \u201cThe one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYe\u2014ye\u2014yes!\u201d sighed out the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more,\u201d pursued the beadle; \u201ccompose your darling feelings for only one more. When is it to come off?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed. At length summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble\u2019s neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was \u201ca irresistible duck.\u201d\r\n\r\nMatters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady\u2019s spirits. While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman\u2019s decease.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; \u201cI\u2019ll call at Sowerberry\u2019s as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning. Was it that as frightened you, love?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything particular, dear,\u201d said the lady evasively.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must have been something, love,\u201d urged Mr. Bumble. \u201cWon\u2019t you tell your own B.?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now,\u201d rejoined the lady; \u201cone of these days. After we\u2019re married, dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter we\u2019re married!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t any impudence from any of them male paupers as\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, love!\u201d interposed the lady, hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I thought it was,\u201d continued Mr. Bumble; \u201cif I thought as any one of \u2019em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have dared to do it, love,\u201d responded the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey had better not!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. \u201cLet me see any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I can tell him that he wouldn\u2019t do it a second time!\u201d\r\n\r\nUnembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady\u2019s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was indeed a dove.\r\n\r\nThe dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers\u2019 ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up. Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little surprised.\r\n\r\nThe cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other. Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity. A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman\u2019s nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!\u201d said Charlotte; \u201ctry him, do; only this one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a delicious thing is a oyster!\u201d remarked Mr. Claypole, after he had swallowed it. \u201cWhat a pity it is, a number of \u2019em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn\u2019t it, Charlotte?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a cruelty,\u201d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is,\u201d acquiesced Mr. Claypole. \u201cAn\u2019t yer fond of oysters?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot overmuch,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cI like to see you eat \u2019em, Noah dear, better than eating \u2019em myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLor!\u201d said Noah, reflectively; \u201chow queer!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave another,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cHere\u2019s one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t manage any more,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. Come here, Charlotte, and I\u2019ll kiss yer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. \u201cSay that again, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nCharlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron. Mr. Claypole, without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cHow dare you mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him, you insolent minx? Kiss her!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation. \u201cFaugh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it!\u201d said Noah, blubbering. \u201cShe\u2019s always a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Noah,\u201d cried Charlotte, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYer are; yer know yer are!\u201d retorted Noah. \u201cShe\u2019s always a-doin\u2019 of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. \u201cTake yourself downstairs, ma\u2019am. Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman\u2019s shell after breakfast to-morrow morning. Do you hear sir? Kissing!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, holding up his hands. \u201cThe sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful! If Parliament don\u2019t take their abominable courses under consideration, this country\u2019s ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!\u201d With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker\u2019s premises.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman\u2019s funeral, let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nLOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\u201cWolves tear your throats!\u201d muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth. \u201cI wish I was among some of you; you\u2019d howl the hoarser for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers.\r\n\r\nThere was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, you white-livered hound!\u201d cried the robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead. \u201cStop!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with.\r\n\r\n\u201cBear a hand with the boy,\u201d cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his confederate. \u201cCome back!\u201d\r\n\r\nToby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuicker!\u201d cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket. \u201cDon\u2019t play booty with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the noise grew louder. Sikes, again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all up, Bill!\u201d cried Toby; \u201cdrop the kid, and show \u2019em your heels.\u201d With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed. Sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cHo, ho, there!\u201d cried a tremulous voice in the rear. \u201cPincher! Neptune! Come here, come here!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the command. Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy advice, or, leastways, I should say, my orders, is,\u201d said the fattest man of the party, \u201cthat we \u2019mediately go home again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,\u201d said a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,\u201d said the third, who had called the dogs back, \u201cMr. Giles ought to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d replied the shorter man; \u201cand whatever Mr. Giles says, it isn\u2019t our place to contradict him. No, no, I know my sitiwation! Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.\u201d To tell the truth, the little man did seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are afraid, Brittles,\u201d said Mr. Giles.\r\n\r\n\u201cI an\u2019t,\u201d said Brittles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are,\u201d said Giles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,\u201d said Brittles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lie, Brittles,\u201d said Mr. Giles.\r\n\r\nNow, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles\u2019s taunt; and Mr. Giles\u2019s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment. The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cwe\u2019re all afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the party.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I do,\u201d replied the man. \u201cIt\u2019s natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances. I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d said Brittles; \u201conly there\u2019s no call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that he was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, \u201cwhat a man will do, when his blood is up. I should have committed murder\u2014I know I should\u2014if we\u2019d caught one of them rascals.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what it was,\u201d said Mr. Giles; \u201cit was the gate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder if it was,\u201d exclaimed Brittles, catching at the idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may depend upon it,\u201d said Giles, \u201cthat that gate stopped the flow of the excitement. I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment. It was quite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit. Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty.\r\n\r\nEncouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire. Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne.\r\n\r\nThe air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke. The grass was wet; the pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning. Still, Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him.\r\n\r\nMorning drew on apace. The air become more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue\u2014the death of night, rather than the birth of day\u2014glimmered faintly in the sky. The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes. The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes. But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay.\r\n\r\nAt length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood. He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain. Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man. But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither.\r\n\r\nAnd now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing\u2014for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber\u2019s grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\r\n\r\nThus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a road. Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him.\r\n\r\nHe looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he could reach. Pitying his condition, they might have compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields. He summoned up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it.\r\n\r\nAs he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it before. He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.\r\n\r\nThat garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed the two men\u2019s mercy. It was the very house they had attempted to rob.\r\n\r\nOliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight. Flight! He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he fly? He pushed against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges. He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.\r\n\r\nIt happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it was Mr. Giles\u2019s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society. But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was about half-past two,\u201d said Mr. Giles, \u201cor I wouldn\u2019t swear that it mightn\u2019t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014Heerd a noise,\u201d continued Mr. Giles. \u201cI says, at first, \u2018This is illusion\u2019; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sort of a noise?\u201d asked the cook.\r\n\r\n\u201cA kind of a busting noise,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMore like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,\u201d suggested Brittles.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was, when you heerd it, sir,\u201d rejoined Mr. Giles; \u201cbut, at this time, it had a busting sound. I turned down the clothes\u201d; continued Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, \u201csat up in bed; and listened.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated \u201cLor!\u201d and drew their chairs closer together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI heerd it now, quite apparent,\u201d resumed Mr. Giles. \u201c\u2018Somebody,\u2019 I says, \u2018is forcing of a door, or window; what\u2019s to be done? I\u2019ll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat,\u2019 I says, \u2018may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nHere, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tossed off the clothes,\u201d said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, \u201cgot softly out of bed; drew on a pair of\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLadies present, Mr. Giles,\u201d murmured the tinker.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014Of shoes, sir,\u201d said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great emphasis on the word; \u201cseized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room. \u2018Brittles,\u2019 I says, when I had woke him, \u2018don\u2019t be frightened!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you did,\u201d observed Brittles, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019re dead men, I think, Brittles,\u2019 I says,\u201d continued Giles; \u201c\u2018but don\u2019t be frightened.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he frightened?\u201d asked the cook.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Mr. Giles. \u201cHe was as firm\u2014ah! pretty near as firm as I was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should have died at once, I\u2019m sure, if it had been me,\u201d observed the housemaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a woman,\u201d retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrittles is right,\u201d said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly; \u201cfrom a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle\u2019s hob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark,\u2014as it might be so.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair. The cook and housemaid screamed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a knock,\u201d said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. \u201cOpen the door, somebody.\u201d\r\n\r\nNobody moved.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the morning,\u201d said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him, and looking very blank himself; \u201cbut the door must be opened. Do you hear, somebody?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep. The women were out of the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,\u201d said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, \u201cI am ready to make one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nBrittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front. The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear. By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs\u2019 tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely.\r\n\r\nThese precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker\u2019s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and gave the word of command to open the door. Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other\u2019s shoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion.\r\n\r\n\u201cA boy!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the background. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the\u2014eh?\u2014Why\u2014Brittles\u2014look here\u2014don\u2019t you know?\u201d\r\n\r\nBrittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he uttered a loud cry. Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere he is!\u201d bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase; \u201chere\u2019s one of the thieves, ma\u2019am! Here\u2019s a thief, miss! Wounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014In a lantern, miss,\u201d cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.\r\n\r\nThe two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged. In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.\r\n\r\n\u201cGiles!\u201d whispered the voice from the stair-head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here, miss,\u201d replied Mr. Giles. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, miss; I ain\u2019t much injured. He didn\u2019t make a very desperate resistance, miss! I was soon too many for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d replied the young lady; \u201cyou frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWounded desperate, miss,\u201d replied Giles, with indescribable complacency.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looks as if he was a-going, miss,\u201d bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, pray; there\u2019s a good man!\u201d rejoined the lady. \u201cWait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away. She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles\u2019s room; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey: from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut won\u2019t you take one look at him, first, miss?\u201d asked Mr. Giles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he had skilfully brought down. \u201cNot one little peep, miss?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now, for the world,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cPoor fellow! Oh! treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then, bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nHAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED\r\n\r\nIn a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.\r\n\r\nOf the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her. Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion.\r\n\r\nThe younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God\u2019s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers.\r\n\r\nShe was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions. The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness.\r\n\r\nShe was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?\u201d asked the old lady, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn hour and twelve minutes, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is always slow,\u201d remarked the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrittles always was a slow boy, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the attendant. And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gets worse instead of better, I think,\u201d said the elder lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,\u201d said the young lady, smiling.\r\n\r\nMr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never heard of such a thing!\u201d exclaimed the fat gentleman. \u201cMy dear Mrs. Maylie\u2014bless my soul\u2014in the silence of the night, too\u2014I never heard of such a thing!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,\u201d said the fat gentleman. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send? Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I\u2019m sure, under such circumstances. Dear, dear! So unexpected! In the silence of the night, too!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you, Miss Rose,\u201d said the doctor, turning to the young lady, \u201cI\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! very much so, indeed,\u201d said Rose, interrupting him; \u201cbut there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! to be sure,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cso there is. That was your handiwork, Giles, I understand.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour.\r\n\r\n\u201cHonour, eh?\u201d said the doctor; \u201cwell, I don\u2019t know; perhaps it\u2019s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you\u2019ve fought a duel, Giles.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party.\r\n\r\n\u201cGad, that\u2019s true!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cWhere is he? Show me the way. I\u2019ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That\u2019s the little window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn\u2019t have believed it!\u201d\r\n\r\nTalking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as \u201cthe doctor,\u201d had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above. At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,\u201d said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is not in danger, I hope?\u201d said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that would not be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cthough I don\u2019t think he is. Have you seen the thief?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d rejoined the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor heard anything about him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d interposed Mr. Giles; \u201cbut I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage.\r\n\r\n\u201cRose wished to see the man,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHumph!\u201d rejoined the doctor. \u201cThere is nothing very alarming in his appearance. Have you any objection to see him in my presence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it be necessary,\u201d replied the old lady, \u201ccertainly not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I think it is necessary,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cat all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me\u2014Miss Rose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nRELATES WHAT OLIVER\u2019S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM\r\n\r\nWith many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady\u2019s arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door, \u201clet us hear what you think of him. He has not been shaved very recently, but he don\u2019t look at all ferocious notwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in visiting order.\u201d\r\n\r\nStepping before them, he looked into the room. Motioning them to advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed. Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow.\r\n\r\nThe honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver\u2019s hair from his face. As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can this mean?\u201d exclaimed the elder lady. \u201cThis poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVice,\u201d said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, \u201ctakes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shall not enshrine her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut at so early an age!\u201d urged Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear young lady,\u201d rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head; \u201ccrime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone. The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, can you\u2014oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?\u201d said Rose.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut even if he has been wicked,\u201d pursued Rose, \u201cthink how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother\u2019s love, or the comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy\u2019s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment. Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear love,\u201d said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, \u201cdo you think I would harm a hair of his head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Rose, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, surely,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cmy days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to save him, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me think, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the doctor; \u201clet me think.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully. After various exclamations of \u201cI\u2019ve got it now\u201d and \u201cno, I haven\u2019t,\u201d and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cI think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You don\u2019t object to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnless there is some other way of preserving the child,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no other,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNo other, take my word for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen my aunt invests you with full power,\u201d said Rose, smiling through her tears; \u201cbut pray don\u2019t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to think,\u201d retorted the doctor, \u201cthat everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,\u201d returned Rose, blushing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, laughing heartily, \u201cthat is no very difficult matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn\u2019t be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger. Now I make this stipulation\u2014that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, aunt!\u201d entreated Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, aunt!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIs is a bargain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe cannot be hardened in vice,\u201d said Rose; \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d retorted the doctor; \u201cthen so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.\r\n\r\nThe patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done.\r\n\r\nThe conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him. Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men\u2019s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day\u2019s life brings with it!\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept. He felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur.\r\n\r\nThe momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles. And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went.\r\n\r\nThere were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable. The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale\u2014as indeed he had.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit still!\u201d said the doctor, waving his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles. \u201cMisses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among \u2019em here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles\u2019s condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is the patient to-night, sir?\u201d asked Giles.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo-so\u201d; returned the doctor. \u201cI am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. Giles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mean to say, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, trembling, \u201cthat he\u2019s going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I wouldn\u2019t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d said the doctor, mysteriously. \u201cMr. Giles, are you a Protestant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I hope so,\u201d faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what are you, boy?\u201d said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles.\r\n\r\n\u201cLord bless me, sir!\u201d replied Brittles, starting violently; \u201cI\u2019m the same as Mr. Giles, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen tell me this,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cboth of you, both of you! Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night? Out with it! Come! We are prepared for you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cPay attention to the reply, constable, will you?\u201d said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy\u2019s utmost acuteness. \u201cSomething may come of this before long.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question of identity, you will observe,\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it is, sir,\u201d replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the house broken into,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cand a couple of men catch one moment\u2019s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here\u2019s a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him\u2014by doing which, they place his life in great danger\u2014and swear he is the thief. Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn\u2019t law, he would be glad to know what was.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask you again,\u201d thundered the doctor, \u201care you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?\u201d\r\n\r\nBrittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the runners!\u201d cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe what?\u201d exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Bow Street officers, sir,\u201d replied Brittles, taking up a candle; \u201cme and Mr. Giles sent for \u2019em this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Brittles; \u201cI sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren\u2019t here before, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did, did you? Then confound your\u2014slow coaches down here; that\u2019s all,\u201d said the doctor, walking away.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nINVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen the door,\u201d replied a man outside; \u201cit\u2019s the officers from Bow Street, as was sent to to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nMuch comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?\u201d said the officer; \u201che\u2019s in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have you got a coach \u2019us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?\u201d\r\n\r\nBrittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were.\r\n\r\nThe man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes. The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?\u201d said the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table. \u201cOh! Good-evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the lady of the house,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\nMr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it\u2014one of the two\u2014seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, with regard to this here robbery, master,\u201d said Blathers. \u201cWhat are the circumstances?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution. Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,\u201d said Blathers; \u201cbut my opinion at once is,\u2014I don\u2019t mind committing myself to that extent,\u2014that this wasn\u2019t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied Duff.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?\u201d said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, master,\u201d replied Blathers. \u201cThis is all about the robbery, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll,\u201d replied the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on?\u201d said Blathers.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing at all,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cOne of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it\u2019s nonsense: sheer absurdity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWery easy disposed of, if it is,\u201d remarked Duff.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat he says is quite correct,\u201d observed Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets. \u201cWho is the boy? What account does he give of himself? Where did he come from? He didn\u2019t drop out of the clouds, did he, master?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies. \u201cI know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d rejoined Mr. Blathers. \u201cWe had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That\u2019s the usual way of doing business.\u201d\r\n\r\nLights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with. This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night\u2019s adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last. This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child\u2019s play.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon my word,\u201d he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns, \u201cI hardly know what to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said Rose, \u201cthe poor child\u2019s story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI doubt it, my dear young lady,\u201d said the doctor, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade. What is he, after all, they would say? A runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou believe it, surely?\u201d interrupted Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,\u201d rejoined the doctor; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d demanded Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, my pretty cross-examiner,\u201d replied the doctor: \u201cbecause, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well. Confound the fellows, they will have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman\u2019s pocket; he has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman\u2019s house, to a place which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don\u2019t you see all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see it, of course,\u201d replied Rose, smiling at the doctor\u2019s impetuosity; \u201cbut still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cof course not! Bless the bright eyes of your sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe more I think of it,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthe more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy\u2019s real story. I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! what is to be done?\u201d cried Rose. \u201cDear, dear! why did they send for these people?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. \u201cI would not have had them here, for the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll I know is,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, \u201cthat we must try and carry it off with a bold face. The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that\u2019s one comfort. We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, master,\u201d said Blathers, entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. \u201cThis warn\u2019t a put-up thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what the devil\u2019s a put-up thing?\u201d demanded the doctor, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe call it a put-up robbery, ladies,\u201d said Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor\u2019s, \u201cwhen the servants is in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody suspected them, in this case,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cWery likely not, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Blathers; \u201cbut they might have been in it, for all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore likely on that wery account,\u201d said Duff.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe find it was a town hand,\u201d said Blathers, continuing his report; \u201cfor the style of work is first-rate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWery pretty indeed it is,\u201d remarked Duff, in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was two of \u2019em in it,\u201d continued Blathers; \u201cand they had a boy with \u2019em; that\u2019s plain from the size of the window. That\u2019s all to be said at present. We\u2019ll see this lad that you\u2019ve got upstairs at once, if you please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?\u201d said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! to be sure!\u201d exclaimed Rose, eagerly. \u201cYou shall have it immediately, if you will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, thank you, miss!\u201d said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth; \u201cit\u2019s dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink that\u2019s handy, miss; don\u2019t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall it be?\u201d asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard.\r\n\r\n\u201cA little drop of spirits, master, if it\u2019s all the same,\u201d replied Blathers. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold ride from London, ma\u2019am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest; \u201cI have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,\u201d said Mr. Duff, assisting his colleague\u2019s memory.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was something in this way, warn\u2019t it?\u201d rejoined Mr. Blathers; \u201cthat was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou always gave that to him\u201d replied Duff. \u201cIt was the Family Pet, I tell you. Conkey hadn\u2019t any more to do with it than I had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d retorted Mr. Blathers; \u201cI know better. Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was! Better than any novel-book I ever see!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,\u201d said Blathers. \u201cThis here Conkey Chickweed\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cConkey means Nosey, ma\u2019am,\u201d interposed Duff.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course the lady knows that, don\u2019t she?\u201d demanded Mr. Blathers. \u201cAlways interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I\u2019ve seen \u2019em off\u2019en. He warn\u2019t one of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high. He was wery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about \u2019em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost \u2019em. However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don\u2019t know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house. \u2018I see him, Spyers,\u2019 said Chickweed, \u2018pass my house yesterday morning,\u2019 \u2018Why didn\u2019t you up, and collar him!\u2019 says Spyers. \u2018I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\u2019 says the poor man; \u2018but we\u2019re sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o\u2019clock at night he passed again.\u2019 Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment\u2019s notice. He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, \u2018Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!\u2019 Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry. Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, \u2018Thieves!\u2019 and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; \u2018Which is the man?\u2019 \u2018D\u2014me!\u2019 says Chickweed, \u2018I\u2019ve lost him again!\u2019 It was a remarkable occurrence, but he warn\u2019t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again. At last, he couldn\u2019t help shutting \u2019em, to ease \u2019em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a-roaring out, \u2018Here he is!\u2019 Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday\u2019s one, the man\u2019s lost again! This was done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did Jem Spyers say?\u201d inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story.\r\n\r\n\u201cJem Spyers,\u201d resumed the officer, \u201cfor a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood his business. But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says \u2018Chickweed, I\u2019ve found out who done this here robbery.\u2019 \u2018Have you?\u2019 said Chickweed. \u2018Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!\u2019 \u2018Come!\u2019 said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, \u2018none of that gammon! You did it yourself.\u2019 So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he hadn\u2019t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!\u201d said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs together.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery curious, indeed,\u201d observed the doctor. \u201cNow, if you please, you can walk upstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, sir,\u201d returned Mr. Blathers. Closely following Mr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver\u2019s bedroom; Mr. Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle.\r\n\r\nOliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had appeared yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward\u2014in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been passing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding, \u201cthis is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d\u2019 ye-call-him\u2019s grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.\u201d\r\n\r\nMessrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus recommended to their notice. The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to deny that, I suppose?\u201d said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all done for the\u2014for the best, sir,\u201d answered Giles. \u201cI am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn\u2019t have meddled with him. I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThought it was what boy?\u201d inquired the senior officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe housebreaker\u2019s boy, sir!\u201d replied Giles. \u201cThey\u2014they certainly had a boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell? Do you think so now?\u201d inquired Blathers.\r\n\r\n\u201cThink what, now?\u201d replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThink it\u2019s the same boy, Stupid-head?\u201d rejoined Blathers, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; I really don\u2019t know,\u201d said Giles, with a rueful countenance. \u201cI couldn\u2019t swear to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked Mr. Blathers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d replied poor Giles. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is the boy; indeed, I\u2019m almost certain that it isn\u2019t. You know it can\u2019t be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas this man been a-drinking, sir?\u201d inquired Blathers, turning to the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a precious muddle-headed chap you are!\u201d said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt.\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne had been feeling the patient\u2019s pulse during this short dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.\r\n\r\nActing upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn\u2019t know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty.\r\n\r\nAmong other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning.\r\n\r\nWith the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King\u2019s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went.\r\n\r\nIn short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver\u2019s appearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven\u2014and if they be not, what prayers are!\u2014the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nOF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s ailings were neither slight nor few. In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips; \u201cyou shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us. The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days. We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe trouble!\u201d cried Oliver. \u201cOh! dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall give nothing at all,\u201d said Miss Maylie, smiling; \u201cfor, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHappy, ma\u2019am!\u201d cried Oliver; \u201chow kind of you to say so!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will make me happier than I can tell you,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cTo think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more than you can well imagine. Do you understand me?\u201d she inquired, watching Oliver\u2019s thoughtful face.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, ma\u2019am, yes!\u201d replied Oliver eagerly; \u201cbut I was thinking that I am ungrateful now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo whom?\u201d inquired the young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,\u201d rejoined Oliver. \u201cIf they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure they would,\u201d rejoined Oliver\u2019s benefactress; \u201cand Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he, ma\u2019am?\u201d cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition. One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. When they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the boy?\u201d cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle. \u201cDo you see anything\u2014hear anything\u2014feel anything\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat, sir,\u201d cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. \u201cThat house!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; well, what of it? Stop coachman. Pull up here,\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cWhat of the house, my man; eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe thieves\u2014the house they took me to!\u201d whispered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe devil it is!\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cHallo, there! let me out!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalloa?\u201d said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMatter!\u201d exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment\u2019s reflection. \u201cA good deal. Robbery is the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be Murder the matter, too,\u201d replied the hump-backed man, coolly, \u201cif you don\u2019t take your hands off. Do you hear me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear you,\u201d said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014confound the fellow, what\u2019s his rascally name\u2014Sikes; that\u2019s it. Where\u2019s Sikes, you thief?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor\u2019s grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house. Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley.\r\n\r\nHe looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered Oliver\u2019s description!\r\n\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, \u201cwhat do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to rob me, or to murder me? Which is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?\u201d said the irritable doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want, then?\u201d demanded the hunchback. \u201cWill you take yourself off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs soon as I think proper,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver\u2019s account of it. \u201cI shall find you out, some day, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you?\u201d sneered the ill-favoured cripple. \u201cIf you ever want me, I\u2019m here. I haven\u2019t lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty years, to be scared by you. You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.\u201d And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.\r\n\r\n\u201cStupid enough, this,\u201d muttered the doctor to himself; \u201cthe boy must have made a mistake. Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.\u201d With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and returned to the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards. He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am an ass!\u201d said the doctor, after a long silence. \u201cDid you know that before, Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t forget it another time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn ass,\u201d said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes. \u201cEven if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though. I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse. It might have done me good.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him. If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver\u2019s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any. He soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver\u2019s replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth.\r\n\r\nAs Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided, they were enabled to drive straight thither. When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my boy, which house is it?\u201d inquired Mr. Losberne.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat! That!\u201d replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. \u201cThe white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, come!\u201d said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. \u201cYou will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! I hope so!\u201d cried Oliver. \u201cThey were so good to me; so very, very good to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.\r\n\r\nAlas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window. \u201cTo Let.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKnock at the next door,\u201d cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver\u2019s arm in his. \u201cWhat has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the adjoining house, do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe servant did not know; but would go and inquire. She presently returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone to the West Indies, six weeks before. Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backward.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas his housekeeper gone too?\u201d inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment\u2019s pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir\u201d; replied the servant. \u201cThe old gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow\u2019s, all went together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen turn towards home again,\u201d said Mr. Losberne to the driver; \u201cand don\u2019t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded London!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe book-stall keeper, sir?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI know the way there. See him, pray, sir! Do see him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cQuite enough for both of us. If we go to the book-stall keeper\u2019s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run away. No; home again straight!\u201d And in obedience to the doctor\u2019s impulse, home they went.\r\n\r\nThis bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber\u2014a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day\u2014was almost more than he could bear.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his benefactors. After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some months.\r\n\r\nSending the plate, which had so excited Fagin\u2019s cupidity, to the banker\u2019s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them.\r\n\r\nWho can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts! Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature\u2019s face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being. Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight! The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes. Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely spot to which they repaired. Oliver, whose days had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there. The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours. Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest. Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but without pain.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy time. The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts. Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough to please him. Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said: and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it. When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear. There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the other days in that most happy time! There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to Oliver\u2019s ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before. Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o\u2019clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie\u2019s birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her appearance: when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done.\r\n\r\nSo three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver\u2019s were true felicity. With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nWHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK\r\n\r\nSpring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness. The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond. The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad. It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.\r\n\r\nStill, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people. He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing. Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds. Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home. The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual. After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping.\r\n\r\n\u201cRose, my dear!\u201d said the elder lady.\r\n\r\nRose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cRose, my love!\u201d cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her. \u201cWhat is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, aunt; nothing,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is; I can\u2019t describe it; but I feel\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot ill, my love?\u201d interposed Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no! Oh, not ill!\u201d replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; \u201cI shall be better presently. Close the window, pray!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child!\u201d said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, \u201cI never saw you so before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would not alarm you if I could avoid it,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cbut indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I am ill, aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before. Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye. Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale.\r\n\r\nOliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health: assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite well.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, \u201cthat nothing is the matter? She don\u2019t look well to-night, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length, she said, in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not, Oliver. I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps. It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe heavy blow,\u201d said the old lady, \u201cof losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! God forbid!\u201d exclaimed Oliver, hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmen to that, my child!\u201d said the old lady, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cTwo hours ago, she was quite well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is very ill now,\u201d rejoined Mrs. Maylies; \u201cand will be worse, I am sure. My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd consider, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. \u201cOh! consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her. I am sure\u2014certain\u2014quite certain\u2014that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so happy; she will not die. Heaven will never let her die so young.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver\u2019s head. \u201cYou think like a child, poor boy. But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love. I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy. God\u2019s will be done! I love her; and He knows how well!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm. He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully. But he was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances. How should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves?\r\n\r\nAn anxious night ensued. When morning came, Mrs. Maylie\u2019s predictions were but too well verified. Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his face; \u201cthis letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr. Losberne. It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is another letter,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; \u201cbut whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely know. I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it for Chertsey, too, ma\u2019am?\u201d inquired Oliver; impatient to execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some great lord\u2019s house in the country; where, he could not make out.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall it go, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. \u201cI will wait until to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off, without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.\r\n\r\nSwiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work: nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.\r\n\r\nHere he paused, and looked about for the inn. There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign of \u201cThe George.\u201d To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more. Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage. At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nAs it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat lighter heart. He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door.\r\n\r\n\u201cHah!\u201d cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly recoiling. \u201cWhat the devil\u2019s this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d said Oliver; \u201cI was in a great hurry to get home, and didn\u2019t see you were coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDeath!\u201d muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes. \u201cWho would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He\u2019d start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man\u2019s wild look. \u201cI hope I have not hurt you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRot you!\u201d murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his clenched teeth; \u201cif I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night. Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp! What are you doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.\r\n\r\nOliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help. Having seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.\r\n\r\nRose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was delirious. A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber! How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred! And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave\u2019s verge!\r\n\r\nOh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! Oh! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them!\r\n\r\nMorning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside. Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived. \u201cIt is hard,\u201d said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; \u201cso young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother morning. The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast. Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.\r\n\r\nThere was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds.\r\n\r\nA knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts. Another! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young. They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother\u2014a mother once\u2014among the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on.\r\n\r\nOliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was. He had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been. We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done\u2014of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired! There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour. Oliver\u2019s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away. He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die.\r\n\r\nThey sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure. Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep. They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of Rose?\u201d cried the old lady. \u201cTell me at once! I can bear it; anything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must compose yourself,\u201d said the doctor supporting her. \u201cBe calm, my dear ma\u2019am, pray.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me go, in God\u2019s name! My dear child! She is dead! She is dying!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried the doctor, passionately. \u201cAs He is good and merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nCONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER\r\n\r\nIt was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.\r\n\r\nThe night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber. As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace. Looking round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him.\r\n\r\nAs it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person. In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses. Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried the voice. \u201cOliver, what\u2019s the news? Miss Rose! Master O-li-ver!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it you, Giles?\u201d cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.\r\n\r\nGiles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a word!\u201d cried the gentleman, \u201cBetter or worse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter\u2014much better!\u201d replied Oliver, hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank Heaven!\u201d exclaimed the gentleman. \u201cYou are sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cThe change took place only a few hours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door, leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are quite certain? There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?\u201d demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice. \u201cDo not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would not for the world, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cIndeed you may believe me. Mr. Losberne\u2019s words were, that she would live to bless us all for many years to come. I heard him say so.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tears stood in Oliver\u2019s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes. Oliver thought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark\u2014for he could well guess what his feelings were\u2014and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots. That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you had better go on to my mother\u2019s in the chaise, Giles,\u201d said he. \u201cI would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her. You can say I am coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,\u201d said Giles: giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; \u201cbut if you would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. It wouldn\u2019t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them if they did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, \u201cyou can do as you like. Let him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us. Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he took out of the chaise. This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.\r\n\r\nAs they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer. He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing. Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother!\u201d whispered the young man; \u201cwhy did you not write before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie; \u201cbut, on reflection, I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne\u2019s opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why,\u201d said the young man, \u201cwhy run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? If Rose had\u2014I cannot utter that word now\u2014if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that had been the case, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cI fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who can wonder if it be so, mother?\u201d rejoined the young man; \u201cor why should I say, if?\u2014It is\u2014it is\u2014you know it, mother\u2014you must know it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie; \u201cI know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting. If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is unkind, mother,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, my dear son,\u201d returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder, \u201cthat youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more fleeting. Above all, I think\u201d said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son\u2019s face, \u201cthat if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in early life. And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d said the young man, impatiently, \u201che would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so now, Harry,\u201d replied his mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd ever will!\u201d said the young man. \u201cThe mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed. On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman. I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind. Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cit is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet it rest with Rose, then,\u201d interposed Harry. \u201cYou will not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not,\u201d rejoined Mrs. Maylie; \u201cbut I would have you consider\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have considered!\u201d was the impatient reply; \u201cMother, I have considered, years and years. I have considered, ever since I have been capable of serious reflection. My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe shall,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly, mother,\u201d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot coldly,\u201d rejoined the old lady; \u201cfar from it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow then?\u201d urged the young man. \u201cShe has formed no other attachment?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d replied his mother; \u201cyou have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her affections already. What I would say,\u201d resumed the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, \u201cis this. Before you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose\u2019s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision: devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I leave you to discover,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie. \u201cI must go back to her. God bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall see you again to-night?\u201d said the young man, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy and by,\u201d replied the lady; \u201cwhen I leave Rose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell her I am here?\u201d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I long to see her. You will not refuse to do this, mother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cI will tell her all.\u201d And pressing her son\u2019s hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding. The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them. The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient\u2019s situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver\u2019s statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?\u201d inquired the doctor, when he had concluded.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing particular, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cI am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort of thing admirably. Pray, how is Brittles?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy is very well, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone of patronage; \u201cand sends his respectful duty, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cSeeing you here, reminds me, Mr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your favour. Just step into this corner a moment, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness. The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit. At this, the two women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied, \u201cNo, no\u201d; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so. And then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.\r\n\r\nAbove stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman\u2019s good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy. So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.\r\n\r\nOliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days. The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic. The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects. Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie, after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind. If Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed. The window of the young lady\u2019s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning. Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on his morning\u2019s walk. Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.\r\n\r\nNor did Oliver\u2019s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself. It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house. It was quite a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume. It looked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land and wood. There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books. He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two. Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state. It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the mere silent presence of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.\r\n\r\nOliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside. And yet he was asleep. Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew\u2019s house again. There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat beside him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, my dear!\u201d he thought he heard the Jew say; \u201cit is he, sure enough. Come away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe!\u201d the other man seemed to answer; \u201ccould I mistake him, think you? If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn\u2019t a mark above it, that he lay buried there?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up.\r\n\r\nGood Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There\u2014there\u2014at the window\u2014close before him\u2014so close, that he could have almost touched him before he started back: with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting his: there stood the Jew! And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard.\r\n\r\nIt was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were gone. But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for help.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nCONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER\u2019S ADVENTURE; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\r\n\r\nWhen the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver\u2019s cries, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words, \u201cThe Jew! the Jew!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver\u2019s history from his mother, understood it at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat direction did he take?\u201d he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; \u201cI missed them in an instant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, they are in the ditch!\u201d said Harry. \u201cFollow! And keep as near me, as you can.\u201d So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him.\r\n\r\nGiles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.\r\n\r\nOn they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe search was all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles. There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must have been a dream, Oliver,\u201d said Harry Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, indeed, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch\u2019s countenance; \u201cI saw him too plainly for that. I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was the other?\u201d inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cWe had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey took this way?\u201d demanded Harry: \u201care you sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I am that the men were at the window,\u201d replied Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the meadow. \u201cThe tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen watched Oliver\u2019s earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said. Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it. The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men\u2019s shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is strange!\u201d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\u201cStrange?\u201d echoed the doctor. \u201cBlathers and Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance. Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village, furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers. Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success. On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless. After a few days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. She had left her room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all.\r\n\r\nBut, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark. Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face. After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides.\r\n\r\nAt length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\u201cA few\u2014a very few\u2014will suffice, Rose,\u201d said the young man, drawing his chair towards her. \u201cWhat I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.\u201d\r\n\r\nRose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014ought to have left here, before,\u201d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should, indeed,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cForgive me for saying so, but I wish you had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions,\u201d said the young man; \u201cthe fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed. You had been dying; trembling between earth and heaven. We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.\r\n\r\n\u201cA creature,\u201d continued the young man, passionately, \u201ca creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God\u2019s own angels, fluttered between life and death. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you\u2014these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course. You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide. I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not mean that,\u201d said Rose, weeping; \u201cI only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,\u201d said the young man, taking her hand. \u201cRose, my own dear Rose! For years\u2014for years\u2014I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy\u2019s attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us! That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour behaviour has ever been kind and noble.\u201d said Rose, mastering the emotions by which she was agitated. \u201cAs you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d replied Rose, \u201cthat you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love. Look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one hand, gave free vent to her tears. Harry still retained the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your reasons, Rose,\u201d he said, at length, in a low voice; \u201cyour reasons for this decision?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a right to know them,\u201d rejoined Rose. \u201cYou can say nothing to alter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform. I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Harry. I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects. I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf your inclinations chime with your sense of duty\u2014\u201d Harry began.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey do not,\u201d replied Rose, colouring deeply.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you return my love?\u201d said Harry. \u201cSay but that, dear Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,\u201d rejoined Rose, \u201cI could have\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave received this declaration very differently?\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could,\u201d said Rose. \u201cStay!\u201d she added, disengaging her hand, \u201cwhy should we prolong this painful interview? Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it will be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness. Farewell, Harry! As we have met to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother word, Rose,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYour reason in your own words. From your own lips, let me hear it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe prospect before you,\u201d answered Rose, firmly, \u201cis a brilliant one. All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother\u2019s place. In a word,\u201d said the young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, \u201cthere is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads. I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne word more, Rose. Dearest Rose! one more!\u201d cried Harry, throwing himself before her. \u201cIf I had been less\u2014less fortunate, the world would call it\u2014if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny\u2014if I had been poor, sick, helpless\u2014would you have turned from me then? Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not press me to reply,\u201d answered Rose. \u201cThe question does not arise, and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,\u201d retorted Harry, \u201cit will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me. It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, if your lot had been differently cast,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cif you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have been spared this trial. I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.\u201d\r\n\r\nBusy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,\u201d said Rose, extending her hand. \u201cI must leave you now, indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask one promise,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOnce, and only once more,\u2014say within a year, but it may be much sooner,\u2014I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to press me to alter my right determination,\u201d replied Rose, with a melancholy smile; \u201cit will be useless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry; \u201cto hear you repeat it, if you will\u2014finally repeat it! I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word or act, to change it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let it be so,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cit is but one pang the more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand again. But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nIS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?\u201d said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast-table. \u201cWhy, you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell me a different tale one of these days,\u201d said Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope I may have good cause to do so,\u201d replied Mr. Losberne; \u201cthough I confess I don\u2019t think I shall. But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to London. And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds. Too bad, isn\u2019t it, Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,\u201d rejoined Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fine fellow,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cyou shall come and see me when you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe great nobs,\u201d replied Harry, \u201cunder which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cyou are a queer fellow. But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life. There\u2019s something in that. Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.\u201d\r\n\r\nHarry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying, \u201cWe shall see,\u201d and pursued the subject no farther. The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver,\u201d said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, \u201clet me speak a word with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can write well now?\u201d said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to me\u2014say once a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the General Post Office in London. Will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,\u201d exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to know how\u2014how my mother and Miss Maylie are,\u201d said the young man; \u201cand you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she\u2014they, I mean\u2014seem happy and quite well. You understand me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! quite, sir, quite,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would rather you did not mention it to them,\u201d said Harry, hurrying over his words; \u201cbecause it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon you.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications. Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were in the garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrive on!\u201d he cried, \u201chard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHalloa!\u201d cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; \u201csomething very short of flying will keep pace with me. Do you hear?\u201d\r\n\r\nJingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted. It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.\r\n\r\nAnd there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems in high spirits and happy,\u201d she said, at length. \u201cI feared for a time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very glad.\u201d\r\n\r\nTears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose\u2019s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nIN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface. A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance. Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Bumble\u2019s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs. The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not the breeches. The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like the coat, but, oh how different! The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one. Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle.\r\n\r\nThere are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them. A field-marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat. Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they? Men. Mere men. Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse. Another beadle had come into power. On him the cocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three descended.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd to-morrow two months it was done!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh. \u201cIt seems a age.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh\u2014there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cI sold myself,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection, \u201cfor six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money. I went very reasonable. Cheap, dirt cheap!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCheap!\u201d cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble\u2019s ear: \u201cyou would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows that!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bumble, ma\u2019am!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d cried the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave the goodness to look at me,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she stands such a eye as that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble to himself, \u201cshe can stand anything. It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers. If it fails with her, my power is gone.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion. The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble\u2019s scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed. He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to sit snoring there, all day?\u201d inquired Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble; \u201cand although I was not snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour prerogative!\u201d sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said the word, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThe prerogative of a man is to command.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?\u201d cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo obey, ma\u2019am,\u201d thundered Mr. Bumble. \u201cYour late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now. I wish he was, poor man!\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.\r\n\r\nBut, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble\u2019s soul; his heart was waterproof. Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him. He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cSo cry away.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.\r\n\r\nNow, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering.\r\n\r\nThe first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room. This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other. This done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose: and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet up!\u201d said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. \u201cAnd take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what something desperate might be. Picking up his hat, he looked towards the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going?\u201d demanded Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to\u2014I\u2019m going, my dear! You are so very violent, that really I\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle. Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence: leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. He had a decided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward. This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities. The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office.\r\n\r\nBut, the measure of his degradation was not yet full. After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cHem!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. \u201cThese women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo there! What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know I was here!\u201d repeated Mrs. Bumble. \u201cWhat do you do here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master\u2019s humility.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou thought they were talking too much?\u201d said Mrs. Bumble. \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, my dear\u2014\u201d urged Mr. Bumble submissively.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very true, you\u2019re matron here, my dear,\u201d submitted Mr. Bumble; \u201cbut I thought you mightn\u2019t be in the way just then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,\u201d returned his lady. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of your interference. You\u2019re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don\u2019t concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day. Be off; come!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant. Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person.\r\n\r\nWhat could Mr. Bumble do? He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight. It wanted but this. He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll in two months!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts. \u201cTwo months! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else\u2019s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly, into the street.\r\n\r\nHe walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty. He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer. It began to rain, heavily, at the moment. This determined him. Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street.\r\n\r\nThe man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak. He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance. He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin-and-water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him. Mr. Bumble\u2019s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger\u2019s eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.\r\n\r\nWhen they had encountered each other\u2019s glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you looking for me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you peered in at the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that I am aware of, unless you\u2019re Mr.\u2014\u201d Here Mr. Bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger\u2019s name, and thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see you were not,\u201d said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth; \u201cor you have known my name. You don\u2019t know it. I would recommend you not to ask for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI meant no harm, young man,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd have done none,\u201d said the stranger.\r\n\r\nAnother silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by the stranger.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen you before, I think?\u201d said he. \u201cYou were differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again. You were beadle here, once; were you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; \u201cporochial beadle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust so,\u201d rejoined the other, nodding his head. \u201cIt was in that character I saw you. What are you now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaster of the workhouse,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume. \u201cMaster of the workhouse, young man!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?\u201d resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble\u2019s eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t scruple to answer freely, man. I know you pretty well, you see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, a married man,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity, \u201cis not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can, than a single one. Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\u201cFill this glass again,\u201d he said, handing Mr. Bumble\u2019s empty tumbler to the landlord. \u201cLet it be strong and hot. You like it so, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot too strong,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou understand what that means, landlord!\u201d said the stranger, drily.\r\n\r\nThe host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow listen to me,\u201d said the stranger, after closing the door and window. \u201cI came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind. I want some information from you. I don\u2019t ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is. Put up that, to begin with.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without. When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cCarry your memory back\u2014let me see\u2014twelve years, last winter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long time,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cVery good. I\u2019ve done it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe scene, the workhouse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the time, night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves\u2014gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot \u2019em in the grave!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lying-in room, I suppose?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the stranger\u2019s excited description.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the stranger. \u201cA boy was born there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA many boys,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA murrain on the young devils!\u201d cried the stranger; \u201cI speak of one; a meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a coffin-maker\u2014I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in it\u2014and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!\u201d said Mr. Bumble; \u201cI remember him, of course. There wasn\u2019t a obstinater young rascal\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not of him I want to hear; I\u2019ve heard enough of him,\u201d said the stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver\u2019s vices. \u201cIt\u2019s of a woman; the hag that nursed his mother. Where is she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered facetious. \u201cIt would be hard to tell. There\u2019s no midwifery there, whichever place she\u2019s gone to; so I suppose she\u2019s out of employment, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d demanded the stranger, sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat she died last winter,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nThe man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought. For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter. With that he rose, as if to depart.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half. He well remembered the night of old Sally\u2019s death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman\u2019s attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist. Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I find her?\u201d said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the intelligence.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly through me,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d cried the stranger, hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow,\u201d rejoined Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt nine in the evening,\u201d said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side, in characters that betrayed his agitation; \u201cat nine in the evening, bring her to me there. I needn\u2019t tell you to be secret. It\u2019s your interest.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk. Shortly remarking that their roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.\r\n\r\nOn glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble touched him on the arm. \u201cFollowing me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly to ask a question,\u201d said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper. \u201cWhat name am I to ask for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonks!\u201d rejoined the man; and strode hastily away.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nCONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.\r\n\r\nThey were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though\u2014the way being dirty\u2014to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination.\r\n\r\nThis was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime. It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river\u2019s bank. A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. But it had long since gone to ruin. The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate.\r\n\r\nIt was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe place should be somewhere here,\u201d said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalloa there!\u201d cried a voice from above.\r\n\r\nFollowing the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.\r\n\r\n\u201cStand still, a minute,\u201d cried the voice; \u201cI\u2019ll be with you directly.\u201d With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that the man?\u201d asked Mr. Bumble\u2019s good lady.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, mind what I told you,\u201d said the matron: \u201cand be careful to say as little as you can, or you\u2019ll betray us at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me here!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?\u201d said Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2014we were only cooling ourselves,\u201d stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cCooling yourselves!\u201d retorted Monks. \u201cNot all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell\u2019s fire out, as a man can carry about with him. You won\u2019t cool yourself so easily; don\u2019t think it!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the woman, is it?\u201d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cHem! That is the woman,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife\u2019s caution.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?\u201d said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know they will always keep one till it\u2019s found out,\u201d said Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what may that be?\u201d asked the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe loss of their own good name,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cSo, by the same rule, if a woman\u2019s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I\u2019m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you understand, mistress?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d said Monks. \u201cHow should you?\u201d\r\n\r\nBestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre.\r\n\r\n\u201cHear it!\u201d he cried, shrinking back. \u201cHear it! Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it. I hate the sound!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese fits come over me, now and then,\u201d said Monks, observing his alarm; \u201cand thunder sometimes brings them on. Don\u2019t mind me now; it\u2019s all over for this once.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, \u201cthe sooner we come to our business, the better for all. The woman know what it is, does she?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout the mother of the boy you named,\u201d replied the matron interrupting him. \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first question is, of what nature was her communication?\u201d said Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the second,\u201d observed the woman with much deliberation. \u201cThe first is, what may the communication be worth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?\u201d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody better than you, I am persuaded,\u201d answered Mrs. Bumble: who did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.\r\n\r\n\u201cHumph!\u201d said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; \u201cthere may be money\u2019s worth to get, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps there may,\u201d was the composed reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething that was taken from her,\u201d said Monks. \u201cSomething that she wore. Something that\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had better bid,\u201d interrupted Mrs. Bumble. \u201cI have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you?\u201d asked the woman, as collectedly as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cSpeak out, and let me know which.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAdd five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold,\u201d said the woman; \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you all I know. Not before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFive-and-twenty pounds!\u201d exclaimed Monks, drawing back.\r\n\r\n\u201cI spoke as plainly as I could,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble. \u201cIt\u2019s not a large sum, either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it\u2019s told!\u201d cried Monks impatiently; \u201cand which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,\u201d answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed. \u201cAs to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if I pay it for nothing?\u201d asked Monks, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can easily take it away again,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cI am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,\u201d submitted Mr. Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: \u201cI am here, my dear. And besides,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, \u201cMr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; but he has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I\u2019m once roused. I only want a little rousing; that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he did want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are a fool,\u201d said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; \u201cand had better hold your tongue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can\u2019t speak in a lower tone,\u201d said Monks, grimly. \u201cSo! He\u2019s your husband, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe my husband!\u201d tittered the matron, parrying the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought as much, when you came in,\u201d rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. \u201cSo much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there\u2019s only one will between them. I\u2019m in earnest. See here!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cgather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let\u2019s hear your story.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say. The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible. The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen this woman, that we called old Sally, died,\u201d the matron began, \u201cshe and I were alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there no one by?\u201d asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; \u201cNo sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a soul,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cwe were alone. I stood alone beside the body when death came over it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Monks, regarding her attentively. \u201cGo on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe spoke of a young creature,\u201d resumed the matron, \u201cwho had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy?\u201d said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder, \u201cBlood! How things come about!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe child was the one you named to him last night,\u201d said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; \u201cthe mother this nurse had robbed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn life?\u201d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn death,\u201d replied the woman, with something like a shudder. \u201cShe stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant\u2019s sake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe sold it,\u201d cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; \u201cdid she sell it? Where? When? To whom? How long before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,\u201d said the matron, \u201cshe fell back and died.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout saying more?\u201d cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie! I\u2019ll not be played with. She said more. I\u2019ll tear the life out of you both, but I\u2019ll know what it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t utter another word,\u201d said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man\u2019s violence; \u201cbut she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich contained\u2014\u201d interposed Monks, stretching forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cit was a pawnbroker\u2019s duplicate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn good time I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d said the woman. \u201cI judge that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker\u2019s interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed. Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand. The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it now?\u201d asked Monks quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands. It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has the word \u2018Agnes\u2019 engraved on the inside,\u201d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this is all?\u201d said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll,\u201d replied the woman.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,\u201d said his wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; \u201cand I want to know nothing; for it\u2019s safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may ask,\u201d said Monks, with some show of surprise; \u201cbut whether I answer or not is another question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014Which makes three,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that what you expected to get from me?\u201d demanded the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cThe other question?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d rejoined Monks; \u201cnor against me either. See here! But don\u2019t move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble\u2019s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook down,\u201d said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. \u201cDon\u2019t fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles. There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you flung a man\u2019s body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?\u201d said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,\u201d replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought.\r\n\r\nMonks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone.\r\n\r\nThe three looking into each other\u2019s faces, seemed to breathe more freely.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position. \u201cIf the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?\u201d said Monks, with a threatening look. \u201cI am not afraid of your wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may depend upon me, young man,\u201d answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. \u201cOn everybody\u2019s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad, for your sake, to hear it,\u201d remarked Monks. \u201cLight your lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife. Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water.\r\n\r\nThey traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors. The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.\r\n\r\nThey were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nINTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER\r\n\r\nOn the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.\r\n\r\nThe room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings. It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane. Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman\u2019s having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week\u2019s growth. The dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention. Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber\u2019s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes\u2019s question.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot long gone seven,\u201d said the girl. \u201cHow do you feel to-night, Bill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs weak as water,\u201d replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs. \u201cHere; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.\u201d\r\n\r\nIllness had not improved Mr. Sikes\u2019s temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhining are you?\u201d said Sikes. \u201cCome! Don\u2019t stand snivelling there. If you can\u2019t do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear you,\u201d replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh. \u201cWhat fancy have you got in your head now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you\u2019ve thought better of it, have you?\u201d growled Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her eye. \u201cAll the better for you, you have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mean to say, you\u2019d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,\u201d said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried Mr. Sikes. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch a number of nights,\u201d said the girl, with a touch of woman\u2019s tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her voice: \u201csuch a number of nights as I\u2019ve been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I\u2019ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn\u2019t have served me as you did just now, if you\u2019d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d rejoined Mr. Sikes, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Why, damme, now, the girls\u2019s whining again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. \u201cDon\u2019t you seem to mind me. It\u2019ll soon be over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll be over?\u201d demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. \u201cWhat foolery are you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don\u2019t come over me with your woman\u2019s nonsense.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats. Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy\u2019s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here, my dear?\u201d said Fagin, looking in.\r\n\r\n\u201cLend a hand to the girl, can\u2019t you?\u201d replied Sikes impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t stand chattering and grinning at me!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl\u2019s assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient\u2019s throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGive her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,\u201d said Mr. Dawkins; \u201cand you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in producing the desired effect. The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what evil wind has blowed you here?\u201d he asked Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I\u2019ve brought something good with me, that you\u2019ll be glad to see. Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn compliance with Mr. Fagin\u2019s request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence.\r\n\r\n\u201cSitch a rabbit pie, Bill,\u201d exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty; \u201csitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there\u2019s no occasion to pick \u2019em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it\u2019ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn\u2019t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,\u2014oh no! Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo\u2019ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!\u201d\r\n\r\nUttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, Bill; you\u2019ll do now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Sikes; \u201cI might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you\u2019d have done anything to help me. What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly hear him, boys!\u201d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cAnd us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe things is well enough in their way,\u201d observed Mr. Sikes: a little soothed as he glanced over the table; \u201cbut what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that \u2019ere dog.\u2014Drive him down, Charley!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never see such a jolly dog as that,\u201d cried Master Bates, doing as he was desired. \u201cSmelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He\u2019d make his fortun\u2019 on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your din,\u201d cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily. \u201cWhat have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what about the other fortnight?\u201d demanded Sikes. \u201cWhat about the other fortnight that you\u2019ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, Bill. I can\u2019t go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn\u2019t help it, upon my honour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon your what?\u201d growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. \u201cHere! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it\u2019ll choke me dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be out of temper, my dear,\u201d urged Fagin, submissively. \u201cI have never forgot you, Bill; never once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019ll pound it that you han\u2019t,\u201d replied Sikes, with a bitter grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn\u2019t been for the girl, I might have died.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere now, Bill,\u201d remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says true enough there!\u201d said Nancy, coming hastily forward. \u201cLet him be; let him be.\u201d\r\n\r\nNancy\u2019s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to make.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well,\u201d said Mr. Sikes; \u201cbut I must have some blunt from you to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t a piece of coin about me,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got lots at home,\u201d retorted Sikes; \u201cand I must have some from there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLots!\u201d cried Fagin, holding up is hands. \u201cI haven\u2019t so much as would\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cbut I must have some to-night; and that\u2019s flat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Fagin, with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019ll send the Artful round presently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t do nothing of the kind,\u201d rejoined Mr. Sikes. \u201cThe Artful\u2019s a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it. Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I\u2019ll lie down and have a snooze while she\u2019s gone.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn\u2019t get any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady\u2019s return.\r\n\r\nIn due course, they arrived at Fagin\u2019s abode, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends. Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas nobody been, Toby?\u201d asked Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a living leg,\u201d answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; \u201cit\u2019s been as dull as swipes. You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I\u2019m as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn\u2019t had the good natur\u2019 to amuse this youngster. Horrid dull, I\u2019m blessed if I an\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn\u2019t value his losses the snap of his little finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWot a rum chap you are, Tom!\u201d said Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling. \u201cAm I, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA very clever fellow, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, patting him on the shoulder, and winking to his other pupils.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an\u2019t he, Fagin?\u201d asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt at all of that, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an\u2019t it, Fagin?\u201d pursued Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so, indeed, my dear. They\u2019re only jealous, Tom, because he won\u2019t give it to them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried Tom, triumphantly, \u201cthat\u2019s where it is! He has cleaned me out. But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can\u2019t I, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don\u2019t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley! It\u2019s time you were on the lay. Come! It\u2019s near ten, and nothing done yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Fagin, when they had left the room, \u201cI\u2019ll go and get you that cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money, for I\u2019ve got none to lock up, my dear\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u2014none to lock up. It\u2019s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I\u2019m fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!\u201d he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; \u201cwho\u2019s that? Listen!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man\u2019s voice reached her ears. The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time.\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; \u201cit\u2019s the man I expected before; he\u2019s coming downstairs. Not a word about the money while he\u2019s here, Nance. He won\u2019t stop long. Not ten minutes, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man\u2019s step was heard upon the stairs without. He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her.\r\n\r\nIt was Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one of my young people,\u201d said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger. \u201cDon\u2019t move, Nancy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny news?\u201d inquired Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd\u2014and\u2014good?\u201d asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot bad, any way,\u201d replied Monks with a smile. \u201cI have been prompt enough this time. Let me have a word with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her. The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that infernal hole we were in before,\u201d she could hear the man say as they went upstairs. Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story.\r\n\r\nBefore the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest. The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above.\r\n\r\nThe room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending. Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money. When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Nance!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, \u201chow pale you are!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPale!\u201d echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don\u2019t know how long and all,\u201d replied the girl carelessly. \u201cCome! Let me get back; that\u2019s a dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand. They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a \u201cgood-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way. Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run. After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\nIt might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker.\r\n\r\nIf she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment. That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.\r\n\r\nAs that day closed in, the girl\u2019s excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, burn my body!\u201d said the man, raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face. \u201cYou look like a corpse come to life again. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMatter!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cNothing. What do you look at me so hard for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat foolery is this?\u201d demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly. \u201cWhat is it? What do you mean? What are you thinking of?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf many things, Bill,\u201d replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes. \u201cBut, Lord! What odds in that?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you wot it is,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cif you haven\u2019t caught the fever, and got it comin\u2019 on, now, there\u2019s something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too. You\u2019re not a-going to\u2014. No, damme! you wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo what?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t,\u201d said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; \u201cthere ain\u2019t a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I\u2019d have cut her throat three months ago. She\u2019s got the fever coming on; that\u2019s it.\u201d\r\n\r\nFortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the robber, \u201ccome and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I\u2019ll alter it so, that you won\u2019t know it agin when you do want it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face. They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened. He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep. The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe laudanum has taken effect at last,\u201d murmured the girl, as she rose from the bedside. \u201cI may be too late, even now.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes\u2019s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber\u2019s lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house.\r\n\r\nA watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas it long gone the half-hour?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll strike the hour in another quarter,\u201d said the man: raising his lantern to her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,\u201d muttered Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.\r\n\r\nMany of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West-End of London. The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience. She tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses\u2019 heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe woman is mad!\u201d said the people, turning to look after her as she rushed away.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she was alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall. The porter\u2019s seat was vacant. She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, young woman!\u201d said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a door behind her, \u201cwho do you want here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA lady who is stopping in this house,\u201d answered the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lady!\u201d was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. \u201cWhat lady?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Maylie,\u201d said Nancy.\r\n\r\nThe young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. To him, Nancy repeated her request.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat name am I to say?\u201d asked the waiter.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s of no use saying any,\u201d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor business?\u201d said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, nor that neither,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cI must see the lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d said the man, pushing her towards the door. \u201cNone of this. Take yourself off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be carried out if I go!\u201d said the girl violently; \u201cand I can make that a job that two of you won\u2019t like to do. Isn\u2019t there anybody here,\u201d she said, looking round, \u201cthat will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake it up for her, Joe; can\u2019t you?\u201d said this person.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good?\u201d replied the man. \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis allusion to Nancy\u2019s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo what you like with me,\u201d said the girl, turning to the men again; \u201cbut do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty\u2019s sake.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to be?\u201d said the man, with one foot on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,\u201d said Nancy; \u201cand that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d said the man, \u201cyou\u2019re coming it strong!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou give the message,\u201d said the girl firmly; \u201cand let me hear the answer.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man ran upstairs. Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good being proper in this world,\u201d said the first housemaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,\u201d said the second.\r\n\r\nThe third contented herself with wondering \u201cwhat ladies was made of\u201d; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of \u201cShameful!\u201d with which the Dianas concluded.\r\n\r\nRegardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nA STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER\r\n\r\nThe girl\u2019s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the woman\u2019s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview.\r\n\r\nBut struggling with these better feelings was pride,\u2014the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self-assured. The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,\u2014even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when a very child.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard matter to get to see you, lady. If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you\u2019d have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cDo not think of that. Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the person you inquired for.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, lady, lady!\u201d she said, clasping her hands passionately before her face, \u201cif there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,\u2014there would\u2014there would!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said Rose, earnestly. \u201cIf you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,\u2014I shall indeed. Sit down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me stand, lady,\u201d said the girl, still weeping, \u201cand do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better. It is growing late. Is\u2014is\u2014that door shut?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it. \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands. I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old Fagin\u2019s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d said Rose Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cI, lady!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI am the infamous creature you have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God! Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat dreadful things are these!\u201d said Rose, involuntarily falling from her strange companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,\u201d cried the girl, \u201cthat you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness, and\u2014and\u2014something worse than all\u2014as I have been from my cradle. I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI pity you!\u201d said Rose, in a broken voice. \u201cIt wrings my heart to hear you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeaven bless you for your goodness!\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cIf you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows you,\u201d replied the girl; \u201cand knew you were here, for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never heard the name,\u201d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he goes by some other amongst us,\u201d rejoined the girl, \u201cwhich I more than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I\u2014suspecting this man\u2014listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark. I found out, from what I heard, that Monks\u2014the man I asked you about, you know\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Rose, \u201cI understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014That Monks,\u201d pursued the girl, \u201chad seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn\u2019t make out why. A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,\u201d said the girl; \u201cand there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery. But I did; and I saw him no more till last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what occurred then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, lady. Last night he came again. Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door. The first words I heard Monks say were these: \u2018So the only proofs of the boy\u2019s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.\u2019 They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got the young devil\u2019s money safely now, he\u2019d rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father\u2019s will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit of him besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is all this!\u201d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cThen, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy\u2019s life without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn\u2019t, he\u2019d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. \u2018In short, Fagin,\u2019 he says, \u2018Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as I\u2019ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis brother!\u201d exclaimed Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cThose were his words,\u201d said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually. \u201cAnd more. When he spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged spaniel was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not mean,\u201d said Rose, turning very pale, \u201cto tell me that this was said in earnest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,\u201d replied the girl, shaking her head. \u201cHe is an earnest man when his hatred is up. I know many who do worse things; but I\u2019d rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once. It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this. I must get back quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what can I do?\u201d said Rose. \u201cTo what use can I turn this communication without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors? If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour\u2019s delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish to go back,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI must go back, because\u2014how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?\u2014because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I can\u2019t leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour having interfered in this dear boy\u2019s behalf before,\u201d said Rose; \u201cyour coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed. Oh!\u201d said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face, \u201cdo not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex; the first\u2014the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion. Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady,\u201d cried the girl, sinking on her knees, \u201cdear, sweet, angel lady, you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is never too late,\u201d said Rose, \u201cfor penitence and atonement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; \u201cI cannot leave him now! I could not be his death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should you be?\u201d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing could save him,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cIf I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible,\u201d cried Rose, \u201cthat for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is madness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d answered the girl; \u201cI only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself. I must go back. Whether it is God\u2019s wrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d said Rose. \u201cI should not let you depart from me thus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should, lady, and I know you will,\u201d rejoined the girl, rising. \u201cYou will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what use, then, is the communication you have made?\u201d said Rose. \u201cThis mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do,\u201d rejoined the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut where can I find you again when it is necessary?\u201d asked Rose. \u201cI do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise you solemnly,\u201d answered Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,\u201d said the girl without hesitation, \u201cI will walk on London Bridge if I am alive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStay another moment,\u201d interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door. \u201cThink once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it. You have a claim on me: not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption. Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you? What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is there no chord in your heart that I can touch! Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,\u201d replied the girl steadily, \u201cgive away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths\u2014even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them. When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us? Pity us, lady\u2014pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will,\u201d said Rose, after a pause, \u201ctake some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty\u2014at all events until we meet again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a penny,\u201d replied the girl, waving her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,\u201d said Rose, stepping gently forward. \u201cI wish to serve you indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would serve me best, lady,\u201d replied the girl, wringing her hands, \u201cif you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived. God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nCONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE\r\n\r\nHer situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver\u2019s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie\u2019s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.\r\n\r\nThey purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of the first day. What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion?\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman\u2019s impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver\u2019s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl\u2019s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person. These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason. Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when\u2014the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection\u2014he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.\r\n\r\nDisturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night. After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it be painful to him,\u201d she thought, \u201cto come back here, how painful it will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me\u2014he did when he went away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.\u201d And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.\r\n\r\nShe had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes you look so flurried?\u201d asked Rose, advancing to meet him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,\u201d replied the boy. \u201cOh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never thought you had told us anything but the truth,\u201d said Rose, soothing him. \u201cBut what is this?\u2014of whom do you speak?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the gentleman,\u201d replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate, \u201cthe gentleman who was so good to me\u2014Mr. Brownlow, that we have so often talked about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cGetting out of a coach,\u201d replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, \u201cand going into a house. I didn\u2019t speak to him\u2014I couldn\u2019t speak to him, for he didn\u2019t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him. But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did. Look here,\u201d said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, \u201chere it is; here\u2019s where he lives\u2014I\u2019m going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me! What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street, in the Strand. She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick!\u201d she said. \u201cTell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to go with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute\u2019s loss of time. I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me,\u201d said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising with great politeness, \u201cI beg your pardon, young lady\u2014I imagined it was some importunate person who\u2014I beg you will excuse me. Be seated, pray.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?\u201d said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is my name,\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThis is my friend, Mr. Grimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe,\u201d interposed Miss Maylie, \u201cthat at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow inclined his head. Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,\u201d said Rose, naturally embarrassed; \u201cbut you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver Twist you knew him as,\u201d replied Rose.\r\n\r\nThe words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.\r\n\r\nMr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie\u2019s, and said,\r\n\r\n\u201cDo me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven\u2019s name put me in possession of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA bad one! I\u2019ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,\u201d said Rose, colouring; \u201cand that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m only sixty-one,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. \u201cAnd, as the devil\u2019s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don\u2019t see the application of that remark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201che does not mean what he says.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he does,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he does not,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll eat his head, if he doesn\u2019t,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he\u2019d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,\u201d responded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.\r\n\r\nHaving gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Miss Maylie,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cto return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nRose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow\u2019s house; reserving Nancy\u2019s information for that gentleman\u2019s private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God!\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThis is great happiness to me, great happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie. You must pardon my finding fault with you,\u2014but why not have brought him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is waiting in a coach at the door,\u201d replied Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt this door!\u201d cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word.\r\n\r\nWhen the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time. After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m old enough to be your grandfather. You\u2019re a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver\u2019s behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. \u201cSend Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, rather testily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that I do, sir,\u201d replied the old lady. \u201cPeople\u2019s eyes, at my time of life, don\u2019t improve with age, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could have told you that,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \u201cbut put on your glasses, and see if you can\u2019t find out what you were wanted for, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But Oliver\u2019s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod be good to me!\u201d cried the old lady, embracing him; \u201cit is my innocent boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear old nurse!\u201d cried Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe would come back\u2014I knew he would,\u201d said the old lady, holding him in her arms. \u201cHow well he looks, and how like a gentleman\u2019s son he is dressed again! Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad. I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.\u201d Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.\r\n\r\nLeaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity. Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o\u2019clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home.\r\n\r\nRose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor\u2019s wrath. Nancy\u2019s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment\u2019s consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what the devil is to be done?\u201d said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies. \u201cAre we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly that,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; \u201cbut we must proceed gently and with great care.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGentleness and care,\u201d exclaimed the doctor. \u201cI\u2019d send them one and all to\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind where,\u201d interposed Mr. Brownlow. \u201cBut reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat object?\u201d asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cSimply, the discovery of Oliver\u2019s parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief; \u201cI almost forgot that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d pursued Mr. Brownlow; \u201cplacing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHanging a few of them at least, in all probability,\u201d suggested the doctor, \u201cand transporting the rest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; \u201cbut no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest\u2014or at least to Oliver\u2019s, which is the same thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d inquired the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people. For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him. He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d said the doctor impetuously, \u201cI put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. \u201cThe promise shall be kept. I don\u2019t think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him. She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman\u2019s proposition was carried unanimously.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like,\u201d he said, \u201cto call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must put it to the vote,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cwho may he be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat lady\u2019s son, and this young lady\u2019s\u2014very old friend,\u201d said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece.\r\n\r\nRose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe stay in town, of course,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cwhile there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success. I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow. \u201cAnd as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver\u2019s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough. Come! Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and escorted her into the supper-room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER\u2019S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\nUpon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention.\r\n\r\nThey were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female: for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,\u2014looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys. The woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back. Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough. This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater exertion.\r\n\r\nThus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion,\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on, can\u2019t yer? What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heavy load, I can tell you,\u201d said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue.\r\n\r\n\u201cHeavy! What are yer talking about? What are yer made for?\u201d rejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the other shoulder. \u201cOh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain\u2019t enough to tire anybody\u2019s patience out, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it much farther?\u201d asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch farther! Yer as good as there,\u201d said the long-legged tramper, pointing out before him. \u201cLook there! Those are the lights of London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re a good two mile off, at least,\u201d said the woman despondingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind whether they\u2019re two mile off, or twenty,\u201d said Noah Claypole; for he it was; \u201cbut get up and come on, or I\u2019ll kick yer, and so I give yer notice.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Noah\u2019s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?\u201d she asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow should I know?\u201d replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking.\r\n\r\n\u201cNear, I hope,\u201d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not near,\u201d replied Mr. Claypole. \u201cThere! Not near; so don\u2019t think it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I tell yer that I don\u2019t mean to do a thing, that\u2019s enough, without any why or because either,\u201d replied Mr. Claypole with dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you needn\u2019t be so cross,\u201d said his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pretty thing it would be, wouldn\u2019t it to go and stop at the very first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on,\u201d said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. \u201cNo! I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on. Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I\u2019ve got a head; for if we hadn\u2019t gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer\u2019d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady. And serve yer right for being a fool.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know I ain\u2019t as cunning as you are,\u201d replied Charlotte; \u201cbut don\u2019t put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. You would have been if I had been, any way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,\u201d said Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took it for you, Noah, dear,\u201d rejoined Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid I keep it?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,\u201d said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm through his.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole\u2019s habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her: which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape. Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in earnest. Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John\u2019s Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray\u2019s Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London.\r\n\r\nThrough these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose. At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo give us the bundle,\u201d said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman\u2019s shoulders, and slinging it over his own; \u201cand don\u2019t yer speak, except when yer spoke to. What\u2019s the name of the house\u2014t-h-r\u2014three what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCripples,\u201d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cThree Cripples,\u201d repeated Noah, \u201cand a very good sign too. Now, then! Keep close at my heels, and come along.\u201d With these injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him.\r\n\r\nIf Noah had been attired in his charity-boy\u2019s dress, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public-house.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this the Three Cripples?\u201d asked Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the dabe of this \u2019ouse,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cA gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,\u201d said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise. \u201cWe want to sleep here to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019b dot certaid you cad,\u201d said Barney, who was the attendant sprite; \u201cbut I\u2019ll idquire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShow us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring, will yer?\u201d said Noah.\r\n\r\nBarney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment.\r\n\r\nNow, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation. The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening\u2019s business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said Barney: \u201cstradegers id the next roob.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStrangers!\u201d repeated the old man in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! Ad rub uds too,\u201d added Barney. \u201cFrob the cuttry, but subthig in your way, or I\u2019b bistaked.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.\r\n\r\nMounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d he whispered, looking round to Barney, \u201cI like that fellow\u2019s looks. He\u2019d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already. Don\u2019t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear \u2019em talk\u2014let me hear \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the partition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I mean to be a gentleman,\u201d said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear. \u201cNo more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a gentleman\u2019s life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like that well enough, dear,\u201d replied Charlotte; \u201cbut tills ain\u2019t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTills be blowed!\u201d said Mr. Claypole; \u201cthere\u2019s more things besides tills to be emptied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cPockets, women\u2019s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!\u201d said Mr. Claypole, rising with the porter.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t do all that, dear,\u201d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall look out to get into company with them as can,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!\u201d exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, that\u2019ll do: don\u2019t yer be too affectionate, in case I\u2019m cross with yer,\u201d said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity. \u201cI should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of \u2019em, and follering \u2019em about, unbeknown to themselves. That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you\u2019ve got,\u2014especially as we don\u2019t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed. He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was Mr. Fagin. And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,\u201d said Fagin, rubbing his hands. \u201cFrom the country, I see, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do yer see that?\u201d asked Noah Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have not so much dust as that in London,\u201d replied Fagin, pointing from Noah\u2019s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two bundles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYer a sharp feller,\u201d said Noah. \u201cHa! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; \u201cand that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger,\u2014a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose. However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood stuff that,\u201d observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear!\u201d said Fagin. \u201cA man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman\u2019s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. \u201cHa! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very lucky it was only me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take it,\u201d stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair; \u201cit was all her doing; yer\u2019ve got it now, Charlotte, yer know yer have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo matter who\u2019s got it, or who did it, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk\u2019s eye at the girl and the two bundles. \u201cI\u2019m in that way myself, and I like you for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that way of business,\u201d rejoined Fagin; \u201cand so are the people of the house. You\u2019ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be. There is not a safer place in all this town than is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so. And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I\u2019ve said the word, and you may make your minds easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole\u2019s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you more,\u201d said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. \u201cI have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYer speak as if yer were in earnest,\u201d replied Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat advantage would it be to me to be anything else?\u201d inquired Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cHere! Let me have a word with you outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,\u201d said Noah, getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. \u201cShe\u2019ll take the luggage upstairs the while. Charlotte, see to them bundles.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s kept tolerably well under, ain\u2019t she?\u201d he asked as he resumed his seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite perfect,\u201d rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I suppose if I wasn\u2019t, I shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cBut, I say, she\u2019ll be back if yer lose time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what do you think?\u201d said Fagin. \u201cIf you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he in a good way of business; that\u2019s where it is!\u201d responded Noah, winking one of his little eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society in the profession.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRegular town-maders?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a countryman among \u2019em; and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d take you, even on my recommendation, if he didn\u2019t run rather short of assistants just now,\u201d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cShould I have to hand over?\u201d said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be done without,\u201d replied Fagin, in a most decided manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty pound, though\u2014it\u2019s a lot of money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot when it\u2019s in a note you can\u2019t get rid of,\u201d retorted Fagin. \u201cNumber and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah! It\u2019s not worth much to him. It\u2019ll have to go abroad, and he couldn\u2019t sell it for a great deal in the market.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen could I see him?\u201d asked Noah doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUm!\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhat\u2019s the wages?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLive like a gentleman\u2014board and lodging, pipes and spirits free\u2014half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,\u201d replied Mr. Fagin.\r\n\r\nWhether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, yer see,\u201d observed Noah, \u201cas she will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little fancy work?\u201d suggested Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! something of that sort,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cWhat do you think would suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know. That\u2019s the sort of thing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cMy friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I did mention that, and I shouldn\u2019t mind turning my hand to it sometimes,\u201d rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t pay by itself, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate. \u201cNo, it might not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, then?\u201d asked Noah, anxiously regarding him. \u201cSomething in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk than being at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of the old ladies?\u201d asked Fagin. \u201cThere\u2019s a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the corner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?\u201d asked Noah, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would answer my purpose. Ain\u2019t there any other line open?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah\u2019s knee. \u201cThe kinchin lay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d demanded Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe kinchins, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, \u201cis the young children that\u2019s sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is just to take their money away\u2014they\u2019ve always got it ready in their hands,\u2014then knock \u2019em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy. \u201cLord, that\u2019s the very thing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure it is,\u201d replied Fagin; \u201cand you can have a few good beats chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like that, where they\u2019re always going errands; and you can upset as many kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right!\u201d said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and Charlotte had returned. \u201cWhat time to-morrow shall we say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill ten do?\u201d asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent, \u201cWhat name shall I tell my good friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Bolter,\u201d replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such emergency. \u201cMr. Morris Bolter. This is Mrs. Bolter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bolter\u2019s humble servant,\u201d said Fagin, bowing with grotesque politeness. \u201cI hope I shall know her better very shortly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?\u201d thundered Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Noah, dear!\u201d replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,\u201d said Mr. Morris Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. \u201cYou understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, I understand\u2014perfectly,\u201d replied Fagin, telling the truth for once. \u201cGood-night! Good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah Claypole, bespeaking his good lady\u2019s attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nWHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so it was you that was your own friend, was it?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into between them, he had removed next day to Fagin\u2019s house. \u201cCod, I thought as much last night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery man\u2019s his own friend, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, with his most insinuating grin. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t as good a one as himself anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept sometimes,\u201d replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of the world. \u201cSome people are nobody\u2019s enemies but their own, yer know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe that,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cWhen a man\u2019s his own enemy, it\u2019s only because he\u2019s too much his own friend; not because he\u2019s careful for everybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There ain\u2019t such a thing in nature.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere oughn\u2019t to be, if there is,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat stands to reason. Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number, and some say number seven. It\u2019s neither, my friend, neither. It\u2019s number one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Mr. Bolter. \u201cNumber one for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a little community like ours, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, who felt it necessary to qualify this position, \u201cwe have a general number one, without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the devil!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, \u201cwe are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be so. For instance, it\u2019s your object to take care of number one\u2014meaning yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter. \u201cYer about right there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell! You can\u2019t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNumber two, you mean,\u201d said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d retorted Fagin. \u201cI\u2019m of the same importance to you, as you are to yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d interrupted Mr. Bolter, \u201cyer a very nice man, and I\u2019m very fond of yer; but we ain\u2019t quite so thick together, as all that comes to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly think,\u201d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out his hands; \u201conly consider. You\u2019ve done what\u2019s a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat, that\u2019s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose\u2014in plain English, the halter!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gallows,\u201d continued Fagin, \u201cthe gallows, my dear, is an ugly finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow\u2019s career on the broad highway. To keep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter. \u201cWhat do yer talk about such things for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly to show you my meaning clearly,\u201d said the Jew, raising his eyebrows. \u201cTo be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my little business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number one, the second my number one. The more you value your number one, the more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first\u2014that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully. \u201cOh! yer a cunning old codger!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance. To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter\u2019s respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cMy best hand was taken from me, yesterday morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say he died?\u201d cried Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cnot so bad as that. Not quite so bad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, I suppose he was\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWanted,\u201d interposed Fagin. \u201cYes, he was wanted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery particular?\u201d inquired Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cnot very. He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,\u2014his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner. Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I\u2019d give the price of as many to have him back. You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but I shall know him, I hope; don\u2019t yer think so?\u201d said Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doubtful about it,\u201d replied Fagin, with a sigh. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get any fresh evidence, it\u2019ll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it\u2019s a case of lagging. They know what a clever lad he is; he\u2019ll be a lifer. They\u2019ll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by lagging and a lifer?\u201d demanded Mr. Bolter. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of talking in that way to me; why don\u2019t yer speak so as I can understand yer?\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words, \u201ctransportation for life,\u201d when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all up, Fagin,\u201d said Charley, when he and his new companion had been made known to each other.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more\u2019s a coming to \u2019dentify him; and the Artful\u2019s booked for a passage out,\u201d replied Master Bates. \u201cI must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels. To think of Jack Dawkins\u2014lummy Jack\u2014the Dodger\u2014the Artful Dodger\u2014going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box! I never thought he\u2019d a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest. Oh, why didn\u2019t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor glory!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!\u201d exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. \u201cWasn\u2019t he always the top-sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent! Eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot one,\u201d replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret; \u201cnot one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what do you talk of?\u201d replied Fagin angrily; \u201cwhat are you blubbering for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Cause it isn\u2019t on the rec-ord, is it?\u201d said Charley, chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets; \u201c\u2019cause it can\u2019t come out in the \u2019dictment; \u2019cause nobody will never know half of what he was. How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar? P\u2019raps not be there at all. Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr. Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy; \u201csee what a pride they take in their profession, my dear. Ain\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind, Charley,\u201d said Fagin soothingly; \u201cit\u2019ll come out, it\u2019ll be sure to come out. They\u2019ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he\u2019ll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers. Think how young he is too! What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time of life!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is a honour that is!\u201d said Charley, a little consoled.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe shall have all he wants,\u201d continued the Jew. \u201cHe shall be kept in the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman. Like a gentleman! With his beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he can\u2019t spend it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, shall he though?\u201d cried Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, that he shall,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cand we\u2019ll have a big-wig, Charley: one that\u2019s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we\u2019ll read it all in the papers\u2014\u2018Artful Dodger\u2014shrieks of laughter\u2014here the court was convulsed\u2019\u2014eh, Charley, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d laughed Master Bates, \u201cwhat a lark that would be, wouldn\u2019t it, Fagin? I say, how the Artful would bother \u2019em wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cHe shall\u2014he will!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, to be sure, so he will,\u201d repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I see him now,\u201d cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d cried Charley Bates. \u201cHa! ha! ha! so do I. I see it all afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin. What a game! What a regular game! All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of \u2019em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge\u2019s own son making a speech arter dinner\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend\u2019s eccentric disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cLet me think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I go?\u201d asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for the world,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cAre you mad, my dear, stark mad, that you\u2019d walk into the very place where\u2014No, Charley, no. One is enough to lose at a time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to go yourself, I suppose?\u201d said Charley with a humorous leer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t quite fit,\u201d replied Fagin shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you send this new cove?\u201d asked Master Bates, laying his hand on Noah\u2019s arm. \u201cNobody knows him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, if he didn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d observed Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cMind!\u201d interposed Charley. \u201cWhat should he have to mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally nothing, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, \u201creally nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I dare say about that, yer know,\u201d observed Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. \u201cNo, no\u2014none of that. It\u2019s not in my department, that ain\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWot department has he got, Fagin?\u201d inquired Master Bates, surveying Noah\u2019s lank form with much disgust. \u201cThe cutting away when there\u2019s anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there\u2019s everything right; is that his branch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d retorted Mr. Bolter; \u201cand don\u2019t yer take liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer\u2019ll find yerself in the wrong shop.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.\r\n\r\nPersuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin\u2019s directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner\u2019s frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand. He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter\u2019s whip. Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he had received, which\u2014Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality\u2014were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way.\r\n\r\nHe found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice.\r\n\r\nThere were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table. A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman \u201cTake that baby out,\u201d when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother\u2019s shawl, from some meagre infant. The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock\u2014the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.\r\n\r\nNoah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character\u2019s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen. He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that \u2019ere disgraceful sitivation for.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, will you?\u201d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an Englishman, ain\u2019t I?\u201d rejoined the Dodger. \u201cWhere are my priwileges?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get your privileges soon enough,\u201d retorted the jailer, \u201cand pepper with \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say to the beaks, if I don\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Dawkins. \u201cNow then! Wot is this here business? I shall thank the madg\u2019strates to dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I\u2019ve got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he\u2019ll go away if I ain\u2019t there to my time, and then pr\u2019aps ther won\u2019t be an action for damage against them as kep me away. Oh no, certainly not!\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate \u201cthe names of them two files as was on the bench.\u201d Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request.\r\n\r\n\u201cSilence there!\u201d cried the jailer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d inquired one of the magistrates.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pick-pocketing case, your worship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas the boy ever been here before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe ought to have been, a many times,\u201d replied the jailer. \u201cHe has been pretty well everywhere else. I know him well, your worship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you know me, do you?\u201d cried the Artful, making a note of the statement. \u201cWery good. That\u2019s a case of deformation of character, any way.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, where are the witnesses?\u201d said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! that\u2019s right,\u201d added the Dodger. \u201cWhere are they? I should like to see \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance. For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner\u2019s name engraved upon the lid. This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to. He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you anything to ask this witness, boy?\u201d said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him,\u201d replied the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you anything to say at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear his worship ask if you\u2019ve anything to say?\u201d inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said the Dodger, looking up with an air of abstraction. \u201cDid you redress yourself to me, my man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,\u201d observed the officer with a grin. \u201cDo you mean to say anything, you young shaver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the Dodger, \u201cnot here, for this ain\u2019t the shop for justice: besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and \u2019spectable circle of acquaintance as\u2019ll make them beaks wish they\u2019d never been born, or that they\u2019d got their footmen to hang \u2019em up to their own hat-pegs, afore they let \u2019em come out this morning to try it on upon me. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere! He\u2019s fully committed!\u201d interposed the clerk. \u201cTake him away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh ah! I\u2019ll come on,\u201d replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the palm of his hand. \u201cAh! (to the Bench) it\u2019s no use your looking frightened; I won\u2019t show you no mercy, not a ha\u2019porth of it. You\u2019ll pay for this, my fine fellers. I wouldn\u2019t be you for something! I wouldn\u2019t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me. Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer\u2019s face, with great glee and self-approval.\r\n\r\nHaving seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person.\r\n\r\nThe two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and establishing for himself a glorious reputation.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nTHE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE FAILS.\r\n\r\nAdept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last\u2014richly as he merited such a fate\u2014by her hand.\r\n\r\nBut, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration. Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her\u2014and what more could she do! She was resolved.\r\n\r\nThough all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too. She grew pale and thin, even within a few days. At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest. At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards\u2014she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour. Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. Eleven.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn hour this side of midnight,\u201d said Sikes, raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat. \u201cDark and heavy it is too. A good night for business this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cWhat a pity, Bill, my dear, that there\u2019s none quite ready to be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right for once,\u201d replied Sikes gruffly. \u201cIt is a pity, for I\u2019m in the humour too.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must make up for lost time when we\u2019ve got things into a good train. That\u2019s all I know,\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way to talk, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, venturing to pat him on the shoulder. \u201cIt does me good to hear you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes you good, does it!\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cWell, so be it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha! ha!\u201d laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this concession. \u201cYou\u2019re like yourself to-night, Bill. Quite like yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder, so take it away,\u201d said Sikes, casting off the Jew\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt make you nervous, Bill,\u2014reminds you of being nabbed, does it?\u201d said Fagin, determined not to be offended.\r\n\r\n\u201cReminds me of being nabbed by the devil,\u201d returned Sikes. \u201cThere never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old \u2019un without any father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn\u2019t wonder at, a bit.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo!\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cNance. Where\u2019s the gal going to at this time of night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot far.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat answer\u2019s that?\u201d retorted Sikes. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where,\u201d replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I do,\u201d said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed. \u201cNowhere. Sit down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not well. I told you that before,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cI want a breath of air.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPut your head out of the winder,\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough there,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI want it in the street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t have it,\u201d replied Sikes. With which assurance he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head, flung it up to the top of an old press. \u201cThere,\u201d said the robber. \u201cNow stop quietly where you are, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,\u201d said the girl turning very pale. \u201cWhat do you mean, Bill? Do you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKnow what I\u2019m\u2014Oh!\u201d cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, \u201cshe\u2019s out of her senses, you know, or she daren\u2019t talk to me in that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll drive me on the something desperate,\u201d muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak. \u201cLet me go, will you,\u2014this minute\u2014this instant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell him to let me go, Fagin. He had better. It\u2019ll be better for him. Do you hear me?\u201d cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cHear you!\u201d repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her. \u201cAye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as\u2019ll tear some of that screaming voice out. Wot has come over you, you jade! Wot is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me go,\u201d said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, \u201cBill, let me go; you don\u2019t know what you are doing. You don\u2019t, indeed. For only one hour\u2014do\u2014do!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCut my limbs off one by one!\u201d cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the arm, \u201cIf I don\u2019t think the gal\u2019s stark raving mad. Get up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot till you let me go\u2014not till you let me go\u2014Never\u2014never!\u201d screamed the girl. Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force. She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o\u2019clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further. With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhew!\u201d said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face. \u201cWot a precious strange gal that is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may say that, Bill,\u201d replied Fagin thoughtfully. \u201cYou may say that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?\u201d asked Sikes. \u201cCome; you should know her better than me. Wot does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cObstinacy; woman\u2019s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose it is,\u201d growled Sikes. \u201cI thought I had tamed her, but she\u2019s as bad as ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWorse,\u201d said Fagin thoughtfully. \u201cI never knew her like this, for such a little cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cI think she\u2019s got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it won\u2019t come out\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLike enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she\u2019s took that way again,\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself aloof,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cWe was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it\u2019s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so long has made her restless\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew in a whisper. \u201cHush!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat. Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, now she\u2019s on the other tack!\u201d exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and bade him good-night. He paused when he reached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cLight him down,\u201d said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers. Show him a light.\u201d\r\n\r\nNancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Nancy, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d replied the girl, in the same tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe reason of all this,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cIf he\u201d\u2014he pointed with his skinny fore-finger up the stairs\u2014\u201cis so hard with you (he\u2019s a brute, Nance, a brute-beast), why don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo matter just now. We\u2019ll talk of this again. You have a friend in me, Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog\u2014like a dog! worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes\u2014come to me. I say, come to me. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you well,\u201d replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion. \u201cGood-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.\r\n\r\nFagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain. He had conceived the idea\u2014not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees\u2014that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker\u2019s brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty. The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons. He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without delay.\r\n\r\nThere was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked\u2014to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life\u2014on the object of her more recent fancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith a little persuasion,\u201d thought Fagin, \u201cwhat more likely than that she would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now. There would be the dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker\u2019s room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her glance at parting showed that.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained. \u201cHow,\u201d thought Fagin, as he crept homeward, \u201ccan I increase my influence with her? What new power can I acquire?\u201d\r\n\r\nSuch brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance?\r\n\r\n\u201cI can,\u201d said Fagin, almost aloud. \u201cShe durst not refuse me then. Not for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nNOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION\r\n\r\nThe old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201cBolter,\u201d said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, here I am,\u201d returned Noah. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating. That\u2019s a great fault in this place. Yer never get time enough over yer meals.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can talk as you eat, can\u2019t you?\u201d said Fagin, cursing his dear young friend\u2019s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, I can talk. I get on better when I talk,\u201d said Noah, cutting a monstrous slice of bread. \u201cWhere\u2019s Charlotte?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOut,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cI sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Noah. \u201cI wish yer\u2019d ordered her to make some buttered toast first. Well. Talk away. Yer won\u2019t interrupt me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did well yesterday, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cBeautiful! Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,\u201d said Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear. The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty well, I think, for a beginner,\u201d remarked Mr. Bolter complacently. \u201cThe pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was standing by itself outside a public-house. I thought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know. Eh? Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you, Bolter,\u201d said Fagin, leaning over the table, \u201cto do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d rejoined Bolter, \u201cdon\u2019t yer go shoving me into danger, or sending me any more o\u2019 yer police-offices. That don\u2019t suit me, that don\u2019t; and so I tell yer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the smallest danger in it\u2014not the very smallest,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cit\u2019s only to dodge a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn old woman?\u201d demanded Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young one,\u201d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can do that pretty well, I know,\u201d said Bolter. \u201cI was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school. What am I to dodge her for? Not to\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll yer give me?\u201d asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his employer, eagerly, in the face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you do it well, a pound, my dear. One pound,\u201d said Fagin, wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn\u2019t valuable consideration to be gained.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d inquired Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Lor!\u201d cried Noah, curling up his nose. \u201cYer doubtful of her, are yer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they are,\u201d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Noah. \u201cJust to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they\u2019re respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I\u2019m your man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you would be,\u201d cried Fagin, elated by the success of his proposal.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cWhere is she? Where am I to wait for her? Where am I to go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll that, my dear, you shall hear from me. I\u2019ll point her out at the proper time,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cYou keep ready, and leave the rest to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter\u2019s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin. Six nights passed\u2014six long weary nights\u2014and on each, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time. On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal. It was Sunday.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe goes abroad to-night,\u201d said Fagin, \u201cand on the right errand, I\u2019m sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak. Come with me. Quick!\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him. They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.\r\n\r\nIt was past eleven o\u2019clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them.\r\n\r\nScarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that the woman?\u201d he asked, scarcely above his breath.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded yes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see her face well,\u201d whispered Noah. \u201cShe is looking down, and the candle is behind her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStay there,\u201d whispered Fagin. He signed to Barney, who withdrew. In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see her now,\u201d cried the spy.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlainly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should know her among a thousand.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out. Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cHist!\u201d cried the lad who held the door. \u201cDow.\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the left,\u201d whispered the lad; \u201ctake the left had, and keep od the other side.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl\u2019s retreating figure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on. She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nTHE APPOINTMENT KEPT\r\n\r\nThe church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back. The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. The man stopped too.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were, hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view. Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London\u2019s destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.\r\n\r\nA mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks. The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old Saint Saviour\u2019s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.\r\n\r\nThe girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro\u2014closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer\u2014when the heavy bell of St. Paul\u2019s tolled for the death of another day. Midnight had come upon the crowded city. The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all.\r\n\r\nThe hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it. They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.\r\n\r\nThey walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate. They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up\u2014brushed against them, indeed\u2014at that precise moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot here,\u201d said Nancy hurriedly, \u201cI am afraid to speak to you here. Come away\u2014out of the public road\u2014down the steps yonder!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.\r\n\r\nThe steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour\u2019s Church, form a landing-stairs from the river. To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment\u2019s survey of the place, he began to descend.\r\n\r\nThese stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. At this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.\r\n\r\nSo tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation. He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.\r\n\r\nHe drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing, listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is far enough,\u201d said a voice, which was evidently that of the gentleman. \u201cI will not suffer the young lady to go any farther. Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo humour me!\u201d cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed. \u201cYou\u2019re considerate, indeed, sir. To humour me! Well, well, it\u2019s no matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, for what,\u201d said the gentleman in a kinder tone, \u201cfor what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place? Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you before,\u201d replied Nancy, \u201cthat I was afraid to speak to you there. I don\u2019t know why it is,\u201d said the girl, shuddering, \u201cbut I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fear of what?\u201d asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI scarcely know of what,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI wish I did. Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImagination,\u201d said the gentleman, soothing her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo imagination,\u201d replied the girl in a hoarse voice. \u201cI\u2019ll swear I saw \u2018coffin\u2019 written in every page of the book in large black letters,\u2014aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing unusual in that,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cThey have passed me often.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReal ones,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cThis was not.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him. He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak to her kindly,\u201d said the young lady to her companion. \u201cPoor creature! She seems to need it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cOh, dear lady, why ar\u2019n\u2019t those who claim to be God\u2019s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cA Turk turns his face, after washing it well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven. Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!\u201d\r\n\r\nThese words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself. The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not here last Sunday night,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t come,\u201d replied Nancy; \u201cI was kept by force.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHim that I told the young lady of before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?\u201d asked the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the girl, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn\u2019t give him a drink of laudanum before I came away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he awake before you returned?\u201d inquired the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cNow listen to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ready,\u201d replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis young lady,\u201d the gentleman began, \u201chas communicated to me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly a fortnight since. I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d said the girl earnestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI repeat that I firmly believe it. To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks. But if\u2014if\u2014\u201d said the gentleman, \u201che cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin,\u201d cried the girl, recoiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat man must be delivered up by you,\u201d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not do it! I will never do it!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cDevil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not?\u201d said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d returned the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor one reason,\u201d rejoined the girl firmly, \u201cfor one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise: and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together, and I\u2019ll not turn upon them, who might\u2014any of them\u2014have turned upon me, but didn\u2019t, bad as they are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain; \u201cput Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to deal with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if he turns against the others?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver\u2019s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if it is not?\u201d suggested the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d pursued the gentleman, \u201cthis Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent. In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave I the lady\u2019s promise for that?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cMy true and faithful pledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonks would never learn how you knew what you do?\u201d said the girl, after a short pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d replied the gentleman. \u201cThe intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,\u201d said the girl after another interval of silence, \u201cbut I will take your words.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that night. From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated. When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is tall,\u201d said the girl, \u201cand a strongly made man, but not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don\u2019t forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man\u2019s, that you might almost tell him by that alone. His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can\u2019t be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds\u2014why did you start?\u201d said the girl, stopping suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of having done so, and begged her to proceed.\r\n\r\n\u201cPart of this,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak. I think that\u2019s all I can give you to know him by. Stay though,\u201d she added. \u201cUpon his throat: so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face: there is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA broad red mark, like a burn or scald?\u201d cried the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d said the girl. \u201cYou know him!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I do,\u201d said the gentleman, breaking silence. \u201cI should by your description. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each other. It may not be the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, \u201cIt must be he!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where he had stood before, \u201cyou have given us most valuable assistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to serve you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not persist in saying that,\u201d rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart. \u201cThink now. Tell me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, sir,\u201d rejoined the girl, weeping. \u201cYou can do nothing to help me. I am past all hope, indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou put yourself beyond its pale,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cThe past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment. Come! I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you. Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will be persuaded now,\u201d cried the young lady. \u201cShe hesitates, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear not, my dear,\u201d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sir, I do not,\u201d replied the girl, after a short struggle. \u201cI am chained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave it. I must have gone too far to turn back,\u2014and yet I don\u2019t know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off. But,\u201d she said, looking hastily round, \u201cthis fear comes over me again. I must go home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHome!\u201d repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.\r\n\r\n\u201cHome, lady,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cTo such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life. Let us part. I shall be watched or seen. Go! Go! If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is useless,\u201d said the gentleman, with a sigh. \u201cWe compromise her safety, perhaps, by staying here. We may have detained her longer than she expected already.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d urged the girl. \u201cYou have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat,\u201d cried the young lady, \u201ccan be the end of this poor creature\u2019s life!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d repeated the girl. \u201cLook before you, lady. Look at that dark water. How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them. It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not speak thus, pray,\u201d returned the young lady, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors should!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cGood-night, good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman turned away.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis purse,\u201d cried the young lady. \u201cTake it for my sake, that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI have not done this for money. Let me have that to think of. And yet\u2014give me something that you have worn: I should like to have something\u2014no, no, not a ring\u2014your gloves or handkerchief\u2014anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet lady. There. Bless you! God bless you. Good-night, good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.\r\n\r\nThe sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.\r\n\r\nThe two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge. They stopped at the summit of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cHark!\u201d cried the young lady, listening. \u201cDid she call! I thought I heard her voice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my love,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. \u201cShe has not moved, and will not till we are gone.\u201d\r\n\r\nRose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led her, with gentle force, away. As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street. The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended.\r\n\r\nPeeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made for the Jew\u2019s house as fast as his legs would carry him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nFATAL CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit.\r\n\r\nHe sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side. His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog\u2019s or rat\u2019s.\r\n\r\nStretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep. Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIndeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart.\r\n\r\nHe sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last,\u201d he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. \u201cAt last!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d he said, laying the bundle on the table. \u201cTake care of that, and do the most you can with it. It\u2019s been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.\r\n\r\n\u201cWot now?\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cWot do you look at a man so for?\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamme!\u201d said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. \u201cHe\u2019s gone mad. I must look to myself here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d rejoined Fagin, finding his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014you\u2019re not the person, Bill. I\u2019ve no\u2014no fault to find with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you haven\u2019t, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. \u201cThat\u2019s lucky\u2014for one of us. Which one that is, don\u2019t matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got that to tell you, Bill,\u201d said Fagin, drawing his chair nearer, \u201cwill make you worse than me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAye?\u201d returned the robber with an incredulous air. \u201cTell away! Look sharp, or Nance will think I\u2019m lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLost!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cShe has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already.\u201d\r\n\r\nSikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew\u2019s face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak, will you!\u201d he said; \u201cor if you don\u2019t, it shall be for want of breath. Open your mouth and say wot you\u2019ve got to say in plain words. Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose that lad that\u2019s laying there\u2014\u201d Fagin began.\r\n\r\nSikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously observed him. \u201cWell!\u201d he said, resuming his former position.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose that lad,\u201d pursued Fagin, \u201cwas to peach\u2014to blow upon us all\u2014first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting with \u2019em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken. Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plant we\u2019ve all been in, more or less\u2014of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water,\u2014but of his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them. Do you hear me?\u201d cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage. \u201cSuppose he did all this, what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then!\u201d replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath. \u201cIf he was left alive till I came, I\u2019d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if I did it!\u201d cried Fagin almost in a yell. \u201cI, that knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion. \u201cI\u2019d do something in the jail that \u2019ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I\u2019d fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I should have such strength,\u201d muttered the robber, poising his brawny arm, \u201cthat I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould I!\u201d said the housebreaker. \u201cTry me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who,\u201d replied Sikes impatiently. \u201cWhoever it was, I\u2019d serve them the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him. Sikes leant forward in his chair: looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in.\r\n\r\n\u201cBolter, Bolter! Poor lad!\u201d said Fagin, looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis. \u201cHe\u2019s tired\u2014tired with watching for her so long,\u2014watching for her, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWot d\u2019ye mean?\u201d asked Sikes, drawing back.\r\n\r\nFagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into a sitting posture. When his assumed name had been repeated several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me that again\u2014once again, just for him to hear,\u201d said the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell yer what?\u201d asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat about\u2014 Nancy,\u201d said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough. \u201cYou followed her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo London Bridge?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere she met two people.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo she did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before, who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did\u2014and to describe him, which she did\u2014and to tell her what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she did\u2014and where it could be best watched from, which she did\u2014and what time the people went there, which she did. She did all this. She told it all every word without a threat, without a murmur\u2014she did\u2014did she not?\u201d cried Fagin, half mad with fury.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d replied Noah, scratching his head. \u201cThat\u2019s just what it was!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did they say, about last Sunday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout last Sunday!\u201d replied Noah, considering. \u201cWhy I told yer that before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAgain. Tell it again!\u201d cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey asked her,\u201d said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was, \u201cthey asked her why she didn\u2019t come, last Sunday, as she promised. She said she couldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy\u2014why? Tell him that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them of before,\u201d replied Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat more of him?\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cWhat more of the man she had told them of before? Tell him that, tell him that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that she couldn\u2019t very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,\u201d said Noah; \u201cand so the first time she went to see the lady, she\u2014ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it did\u2014she gave him a drink of laudanum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHell\u2019s fire!\u201d cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew. \u201cLet me go!\u201d\r\n\r\nFlinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cBill, Bill!\u201d cried Fagin, following him hastily. \u201cA word. Only a word.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me out,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me; it\u2019s not safe. Let me out, I say!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHear me speak a word,\u201d rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock. \u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d replied the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014too\u2014violent, Bill?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each other\u2019s faces. They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean,\u201d said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now useless, \u201cnot too violent for safety. Be crafty, Bill, and not too bold.\u201d\r\n\r\nSikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.\r\n\r\nWithout one pause, or moment\u2019s consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage resolution: his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his own door. He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.\r\n\r\nThe girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it. He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet up!\u201d said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is you, Bill!\u201d said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his return.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d was the reply. \u201cGet up.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate. Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet it be,\u201d said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. \u201cThere\u2019s enough light for wot I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBill,\u201d said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, \u201cwhy do you look like that at me!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cBill, Bill!\u201d gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,\u2014\u201cI\u2014I won\u2019t scream or cry\u2014not once\u2014hear me\u2014speak to me\u2014tell me what I have done!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know, you she devil!\u201d returned the robber, suppressing his breath. \u201cYou were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,\u201d rejoined the girl, clinging to him. \u201cBill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me. Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you. You shall have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off. Bill, Bill, for dear God\u2019s sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood! I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them away.\r\n\r\n\u201cBill,\u201d cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, \u201cthe gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent. They told me so\u2014I feel it now\u2014but we must have time\u2014a little, little time!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own.\r\n\r\nShe staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief\u2014Rose Maylie\u2019s own\u2014and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker.\r\n\r\nIt was a ghastly figure to look upon. The murderer staggering backward to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club and struck her down.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nTHE FLIGHT OF SIKES\r\n\r\nOf all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide London\u2019s bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst. Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel.\r\n\r\nThe sun\u2014the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man\u2014burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory. Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray. It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. It did. He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in. If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light!\r\n\r\nHe had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again. Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling. He had plucked it off again. And there was the body\u2014mere flesh and blood, no more\u2014but such flesh, and so much blood!\r\n\r\nHe struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney. Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes. He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. How those stains were dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were bloody.\r\n\r\nAll this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment. Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.\r\n\r\nHe crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay nearly under there. He knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot!\r\n\r\nThe glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the room. He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\nHe went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath. Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept.\r\n\r\nSoon he was up again, and away,\u2014not far into the country, but back towards London by the high-road\u2014then back again\u2014then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed\u2014then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches\u2019 brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.\r\n\r\nWhere could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink? Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people\u2019s way. Thither he directed his steps,\u2014running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail\u2019s pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. But when he got there, all the people he met\u2014the very children at the doors\u2014seemed to view him with suspicion. Back he turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go.\r\n\r\nHe wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place. Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot. At last he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o\u2019clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot. There was a fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it.\r\n\r\nThey made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young\u2014not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he was\u2014with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least\u2014if he had taken care; if he had taken care.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer.\r\n\r\nThis was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back. His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?\u201d asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the fellow, producing one, \u201cthis is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff. Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she\u2019s cured at once\u2014for it\u2019s poison. If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question\u2014for it\u2019s quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. One penny a square. With all these virtues, one penny a square!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated. The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all bought up as fast as it can be made,\u201d said the fellow. \u201cThere are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery, always a-working upon it, and they can\u2019t make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins. One penny a square! Two half-pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy. One penny a square! Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I\u2019ll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHah!\u201d cried Sikes starting up. \u201cGive that back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it clean out, sir,\u201d replied the man, winking to the company, \u201cbefore you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman\u2019s hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half-crown. Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.\r\n\r\nWith the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post-office. He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened.\r\n\r\nThe guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man, dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for your people,\u201d said the guard. \u201cNow, look alive in there, will you. Damn that \u2019ere bag, it warn\u2019t ready night afore last; this won\u2019t do, you know!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything new up in town, Ben?\u201d asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, nothing that I knows on,\u201d replied the man, pulling on his gloves. \u201cCorn\u2019s up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don\u2019t reckon much upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s quite true,\u201d said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window. \u201cAnd a dreadful murder it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas it, sir?\u201d rejoined the guard, touching his hat. \u201cMan or woman, pray, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA woman,\u201d replied the gentleman. \u201cIt is supposed\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Ben,\u201d replied the coachman impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn that \u2019ere bag,\u201d said the guard; \u201care you gone to sleep in there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cComing!\u201d cried the office keeper, running out.\r\n\r\n\u201cComing,\u201d growled the guard. \u201cAh, and so\u2019s the young \u2019ooman of property that\u2019s going to take a fancy to me, but I don\u2019t know when. Here, give hold. All ri\u2014ight!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.\r\n\r\nSikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go. At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans.\r\n\r\nHe went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning\u2019s ghastly figure following at his heels. He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along. He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry. If he stopped it did the same. If he ran, it followed\u2014not running too: that would have been a relief: but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.\r\n\r\nAt times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then. He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now\u2014always. He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky. He threw himself upon the road\u2014on his back upon the road. At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still\u2014a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood.\r\n\r\nLet no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear.\r\n\r\nThere was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night. Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. He could not walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the wall\u2014to undergo new torture.\r\n\r\nFor now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped. Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing. There were but two, but they were everywhere. If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object\u2014some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory\u2014each in its accustomed place. The body was in its place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away. He got up, and rushed into the field without. The figure was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more. The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.\r\n\r\nAnd here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder. Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him. He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air.\r\n\r\nThe broad sky seemed on fire. Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood. The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food. The noise increased as he looked. There were people there\u2014men and women\u2014light, bustle. It was like new life to him. He darted onward\u2014straight, headlong\u2014dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him.\r\n\r\nHe came upon the spot. There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams. The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground. Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers. The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar. He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng. Hither and thither he dived that night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest. Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained.\r\n\r\nThis mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together. He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment. He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder. \u201cHe has gone to Birmingham, they say,\u201d said one: \u201cbut they\u2019ll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there\u2019ll be a cry all through the country.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s somebody to speak to there, at all event,\u201d he thought. \u201cA good hiding-place, too. They\u2019ll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent. Why can\u2019t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I\u2019ll risk it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination.\r\n\r\nThe dog, though. If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him. This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets. He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.\r\n\r\nThe animal looked up into his master\u2019s face while these preparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber\u2019s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along. When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear me call? Come here!\u201d cried Sikes.\r\n\r\nThe animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome back!\u201d said the robber.\r\n\r\nThe dog wagged his tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and called him again.\r\n\r\nThe dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed.\r\n\r\nThe man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return. But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nMONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT\r\n\r\nThe twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly. The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side. At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house. This man was Monks.\r\n\r\nThey walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr. Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped. The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows the alternative,\u201d said Mr. Browlow. \u201cIf he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you say this of me?\u201d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you urge me to it, young man?\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, confronting him with a steady look. \u201cAre you mad enough to leave this house? Unhand him. There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow. But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery. I am resolute and immoveable. If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?\u201d asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy mine,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cThose persons are indemnified by me. If you complain of being deprived of your liberty\u2014you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet\u2014I say again, throw yourself for protection on the law. I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. He hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will decide quickly,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and composure. \u201cIf you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way. If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. It has waited for you two whole days.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will be prompt,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cA word from me, and the alternative has gone for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\nStill the man hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not the inclination to parley,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there\u2014\u201d demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,\u2014\u201cis there\u2014no middle course?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.\r\n\r\n\u201cLock the door on the outside,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants, \u201cand come when I ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is pretty treatment, sir,\u201d said Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak, \u201cfrom my father\u2019s oldest friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is because I was your father\u2019s oldest friend, young man,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow; \u201cit is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man: it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters\u2019s death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would\u2014but Heaven willed otherwise\u2014have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now\u2014yes, Edward Leeford, even now\u2014and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has the name to do with it?\u201d asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his companion. \u201cWhat is the name to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cnothing to you. But it was hers, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger. I am very glad you have changed it\u2014very\u2014very.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is all mighty fine,\u201d said Monks (to retain his assumed designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his face with his hand. \u201cBut what do you want with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a brother,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: \u201ca brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no brother,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cYou know I was an only child. Why do you talk to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAttend to what I do know, and you may not,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI shall interest you by and by. I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for hard names,\u201d interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh. \u201cYou know the fact, and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I also know,\u201d pursued the old gentleman, \u201cthe misery, the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both. I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume. Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon. But it rusted and cankered at your father\u2019s heart for years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they were separated,\u201d said Monks, \u201cand what of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen they had been separated for some time,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends. This circumstance, at least, you know already.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot I,\u201d said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. \u201cNot I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty\u2014for he was, I repeat, a boy, when his father ordered him to marry. Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing to disclose,\u201d rejoined Monks. \u201cYou must talk on if you will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThese new friends, then,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cwere a naval officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year before, and left him with two children\u2014there had been more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three years old.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this to me?\u201d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey resided,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the interruption, \u201cin a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode. Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your father was gifted as few men are. He had his sister\u2019s soul and person. As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him. I would that it had ended there. His daughter did the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour tale is of the longest,\u201d observed Monks, moving restlessly in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief. At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often\u2014it is no uncommon case\u2014died, and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for all griefs\u2014Money. It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion. He went; was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no will\u2014no will\u2014so that the whole property fell to her and you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker. As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other\u2019s face, \u201che came to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never heard of that,\u201d interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture\u2014a portrait painted by himself\u2014a likeness of this poor girl\u2014which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty journey. He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition, to fly the country\u2014I guessed too well he would not fly alone\u2014and never see it more. Even from me, his old and early friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both\u2014even from me he withheld any more particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. Alas! That was the last time. I had no letter, and I never saw him more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI went,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, \u201cI went, when all was over, to the scene of his\u2014I will use the term the world would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him\u2014of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her. The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night. Why, or whither, none can tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen your brother,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other\u2019s chair, \u201cWhen your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected child: was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy me,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI told you I should interest you before long. I say by me\u2014I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name, although for aught he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears. When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment. Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream. I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Monks hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you know it well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDenial to me is vain,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI shall show you that I know more than that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014can\u2019t prove anything against me,\u201d stammered Monks. \u201cI defy you to do it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see,\u201d returned the old gentleman with a searching glance. \u201cI lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him. Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies\u2014whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother\u2019s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here\u2014I made the voyage. You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no one could tell where. I returned. Your agents had no clue to your residence. You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy. I wearied them with new applications. I paced the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now you do see me,\u201d said Monks, rising boldly, \u201cwhat then? Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words\u2014justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man\u2019s Brother! You don\u2019t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you don\u2019t even know that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; \u201cbut within the last fortnight I have learnt it all. You have a brother; you know it, and him. There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death. It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father. You repaired to the place of his birth. There existed proofs\u2014proofs long suppressed\u2014of his birth and parentage. Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, \u2018the only proofs of the boy\u2019s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.\u2019 Unworthy son, coward, liar,\u2014you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,\u2014you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,\u2014you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father\u2019s heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind\u2014you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated charges.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery word!\u201d cried the gentleman, \u201cevery word that has passed between you and this detested villain, is known to me. Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a party.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d interposed Monks. \u201cI\u2014I knew nothing of that; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me. I didn\u2019t know the cause. I thought it was a common quarrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was the partial disclosure of your secrets,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cWill you disclose the whole?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSet your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before witnesses?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I promise too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRemain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you insist upon that, I\u2019ll do that also,\u201d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must do more than that,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cMake restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love. You have not forgotten the provisions of the will. Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned, and then go where you please. In this world you need meet no more.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent agitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man will be taken,\u201d he cried. \u201cHe will be taken to-night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe murderer?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d replied the other. \u201cHis dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is, or will be, there, under cover of the darkness. Spies are hovering about in every direction. I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape. A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will give fifty more,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it. Where is Mr. Maylie?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cand mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cwhat of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this time. They\u2019re sure of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you made up your mind?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2014will be secret with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will. Remain here till I return. It is your only hope of safety.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey left the room, and the door was again locked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked the doctor in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll that I could hope to do, and even more. Coupling the poor girl\u2019s intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good friend\u2019s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day. Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the meeting. We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest: especially the young lady, who may have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now. But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature. Which way have they taken?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDrive straight to the office and you will be in time,\u201d replied Mr. Losberne. \u201cI will remain here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nTHE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE\r\n\r\nNear to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTo reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion. The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman\u2019s door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows. Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner. Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect.\r\n\r\nIn such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark, stands Jacob\u2019s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch. It is a creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name. At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him. Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it\u2014as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch.\r\n\r\nIn Jacob\u2019s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke. Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed. The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die. They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob\u2019s Island.\r\n\r\nIn an upper room of one of these houses\u2014a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described\u2014there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence. One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion. This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish,\u201d said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, \u201cthat you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my fine feller.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you, blunder-head!\u201d said Kags.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I thought you\u2019d have been a little more glad to see me than this,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, look\u2019e, young gentleman,\u201d said Toby, \u201cwhen a man keeps himself so very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it\u2019s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEspecially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him, that\u2019s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,\u201d added Mr. Kags.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care swagger, turned to Chitling and said,\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen was Fagin took then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust at dinner-time\u2014two o\u2019clock this afternoon. Charley and I made our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Bet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor Bet! She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,\u201d replied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, \u201cand went off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital\u2014and there she is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWot\u2019s come of young Bates?\u201d demanded Kags.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d replied Chitling. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken\u2014I went up there and see it with my own eyes\u2014is filled with traps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a smash,\u201d observed Toby, biting his lips. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one will go with this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sessions are on,\u201d said Kags: \u201cif they get the inquest over, and Bolter turns King\u2019s evidence: as of course he will, from what he\u2019s said already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he\u2019ll swing in six days from this, by G\u2014!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should have heard the people groan,\u201d said Chitling; \u201cthe officers fought like devils, or they\u2019d have torn him away. He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends. I can see \u2019em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst \u2019em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they\u2019d tear his heart out!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and Sikes\u2019s dog bounded into the room. They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street. The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d said Toby when they had returned. \u201cHe can\u2019t be coming here. I\u2014I\u2014hope not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he was coming here, he\u2019d have come with the dog,\u201d said Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor. \u201cHere! Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s drunk it all up, every drop,\u201d said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence. \u201cCovered with mud\u2014lame\u2014half blind\u2014he must have come a long way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere can he have come from!\u201d exclaimed Toby. \u201cHe\u2019s been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he\u2019s been many a time and often. But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u201d\u2014(none of them called the murderer by his old name)\u2014\u201cHe can\u2019t have made away with himself. What do you think?\u201d said Chitling.\r\n\r\nToby shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he had,\u201d said Kags, \u201cthe dog \u2019ud want to lead us away to where he did it. No. I think he\u2019s got out of the country, and left the dog behind. He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody.\r\n\r\nIt being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon the table. The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position. They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound. They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room.\r\n\r\nThey had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung Bates,\u201d said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he felt himself.\r\n\r\nThe knocking came again. No, it wasn\u2019t he. He never knocked like that.\r\n\r\nCrackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough. The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must let him in,\u201d he said, taking up the candle.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there any help for it?\u201d asked the other man in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone. He must come in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave us in the dark,\u201d said Kags, taking down a candle from the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.\r\n\r\nCrackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his head under his hat. He drew them slowly off. Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days\u2019 growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall\u2014as close as it would go\u2014and ground it against it\u2014and sat down.\r\n\r\nNot a word had been exchanged. He looked from one to another in silence. If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted. When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started. They seemed never to have heard its tones before.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow came that dog here?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlone. Three hours ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-night\u2019s paper says that Fagin\u2019s took. Is it true, or a lie?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were silent again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn you all!\u201d said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead. \u201cHave you nothing to say to me?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou that keep this house,\u201d said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit, \u201cdo you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may stop here, if you think it safe,\u201d returned the person addressed, after some hesitation.\r\n\r\nSikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it: and said, \u201cIs\u2014it\u2014the body\u2014is it buried?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it!\u201d he retorted with the same glance behind him. \u201cWot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for?\u2014Who\u2019s that knocking?\u201d\r\n\r\nCrackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him. Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure.\r\n\r\n\u201cToby,\u201d said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards him, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me this, downstairs?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad. Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me go into some other room,\u201d said the boy, retreating still farther.\r\n\r\n\u201cCharley!\u201d said Sikes, stepping forward. \u201cDon\u2019t you\u2014don\u2019t you know me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t come nearer me,\u201d answered the boy, still retreating, and looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer\u2019s face. \u201cYou monster!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes\u2019s eyes sunk gradually to the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness you three,\u201d cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he spoke. \u201cWitness you three\u2014I\u2019m not afraid of him\u2014if they come here after him, I\u2019ll give him up; I will. I tell you out at once. He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I\u2019ll give him up. I\u2019d give him up if he was to be boiled alive. Murder! Help! If there\u2019s the pluck of a man among you three, you\u2019ll help me. Murder! Help! Down with him!\u201d\r\n\r\nPouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe three spectators seemed quite stupefied. They offered no interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer\u2019s breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all his might.\r\n\r\nThe contest, however, was too unequal to last long. Sikes had him down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window. There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps\u2014endless they seemed in number\u2014crossing the nearest wooden bridge. One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement. The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.\r\n\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air. \u201cHe\u2019s here! Break down the door!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the King\u2019s name,\u201d cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder.\r\n\r\n\u201cBreak down the door!\u201d screamed the boy. \u201cI tell you they\u2019ll never open it. Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the door!\u201d\r\n\r\nStrokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe,\u201d cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. \u201cThat door. Quick!\u201d He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. \u201cIs the downstairs door fast?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDouble-locked and chained,\u201d replied Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe panels\u2014are they strong?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLined with sheet-iron.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the windows too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and the windows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn you!\u201d cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd. \u201cDo your worst! I\u2019ll cheat you yet!\u201d\r\n\r\nOf all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng. Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead. Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, \u201cTwenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. Some called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tide,\u201d cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and shut the faces out, \u201cthe tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a long rope. They\u2019re all in front. I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and clear off that way. Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house-top.\r\n\r\nAll the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his body. But, from this aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream.\r\n\r\nHe planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet.\r\n\r\nThe water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.\r\n\r\nThe crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers. Again and again it rose. Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him.\r\n\r\nOn pressed the people from the front\u2014on, on, on, in a strong struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion. The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house-top. Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it. Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see the wretch.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have him now,\u201d cried a man on the nearest bridge. \u201cHurrah!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will give fifty pounds,\u201d cried an old gentleman from the same quarter, \u201cto the man who takes him alive. I will remain here, till he come to ask me for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was another roar. At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room. The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left: each man crushing and striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out. The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible, increased.\r\n\r\nThe man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion.\r\n\r\nRoused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second. He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop.\r\n\r\nAt the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down\u2014at that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe eyes again!\u201d he cried in an unearthly screech.\r\n\r\nStaggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. He fell for five-and-thirty feet. There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand.\r\n\r\nThe old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for God\u2019s sake.\r\n\r\nA dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man\u2019s shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out his brains.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nAFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY\r\n\r\nThe events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver found himself, at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, in a travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town. Mrs. Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThey had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree. He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense.\r\n\r\nThe same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne\u2019s assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place. \u201cIt was quite true,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.\u201d So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.\r\n\r\nBut if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee there, there!\u201d cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window; \u201cthat\u2019s the stile I came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and force me back! Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little child! Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will see him soon,\u201d replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands between her own. \u201cYou shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Oliver, \u201cand we\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll take him away from here, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well,\u2014shall we?\u201d\r\n\r\nRose nodded \u201cyes,\u201d for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cIt will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again\u2014I know that too\u2014to think how changed he is; you did the same with me. He said \u2018God bless you\u2019 to me when I ran away,\u201d cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion; \u201cand I will say \u2018God bless you\u2019 now, and show him how I love him for it!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds. There was Sowerberry\u2019s the undertaker\u2019s just as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it\u2014there were all the well-known shops and houses, with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected\u2014there was Gamfield\u2019s cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old public-house door\u2014there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street\u2014there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed again\u2014there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well\u2014there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy dream.\r\n\r\nBut it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head\u2014no, not once; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep. There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down. Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room. The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart. Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping. All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable. They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices.\r\n\r\nAt length, when nine o\u2019clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room. Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door. Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a painful task,\u201d said he, \u201cbut these declarations, which have been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated here. I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said the person addressed, turning away his face. \u201cQuick. I have almost done enough, I think. Don\u2019t keep me here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis child,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, \u201cis your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose heart he might have heard. \u201cThat is the bastard child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe term you use,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, \u201cis a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass. He was born in this town.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the workhouse of this town,\u201d was the sullen reply. \u201cYou have the story there.\u201d He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must have it here, too,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the listeners.\r\n\r\n\u201cListen then! You!\u201d returned Monks. \u201cHis father being taken ill at Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated, who went from Paris and took me with her\u2014to look after his property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her. He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till next day, when he died. Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to yourself\u201d; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; \u201cand enclosed in a few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead. One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of the letter?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter?\u2014A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her. He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery\u2014to be explained one day\u2014prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back. She was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement. He told her all he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his. He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her\u2014prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before\u2014and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted. I believe he had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe will,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver\u2019s tears fell fast.\r\n\r\nMonks was silent.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe will,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, \u201cwas in the same spirit as the letter. He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions\u2014one for Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age. If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong. He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the mother, and his conviction\u2014only strengthened by approaching death\u2014that the child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature. If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d said Monks, in a louder tone, \u201cdid what a woman should have done. She burnt this will. The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot. The girl\u2019s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate\u2014I love her for it now\u2014could add. Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed. The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative.\r\n\r\n\u201cYears after this,\u201d he said, \u201cthis man\u2019s\u2014Edward Leeford\u2019s\u2014mother came to me. He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts. She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she died. Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to France.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere she died,\u201d said Monks, \u201cafter a lingering illness; and, on her death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved\u2014though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before. She would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive. I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot. She was right. He came in my way at last. I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared: of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his being rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe locket and ring?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,\u201d answered Monks without raising his eyes. \u201cYou know what became of them.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her unwilling consort after him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo my hi\u2019s deceive me!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm, \u201cor is that little Oliver? Oh O-li-ver, if you know\u2019d how I\u2019ve been a-grieving for you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, fool,\u201d murmured Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?\u201d remonstrated the workhouse master. \u201cCan\u2019t I be supposed to feel\u2014I as brought him up porochially\u2014when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description! I always loved that boy as if he\u2019d been my\u2014my\u2014my own grandfather,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison. \u201cMaster Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat? Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles, Oliver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, sir,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; \u201csuppress your feelings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do my endeavours, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cHow do you do, sir? I hope you are very well.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple. He inquired, as he pointed to Monks,\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know that person?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw him in all my life,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor sold him anything, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cWhy are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness. But not again did he return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shut the door the night old Sally died,\u201d said the foremost one, raising her shrivelled hand, \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t shut out the sound, nor stop the chinks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe heard her try to tell you what she\u2019d done, and saw you take a paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker\u2019s shop,\u201d said the first.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d added the second, \u201cand it was a \u2018locket and gold ring.\u2019 We found out that, and saw it given you. We were by. Oh! we were by.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd we know more than that,\u201d resumed the first, \u201cfor she told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to see the pawnbroker himself?\u201d asked Mr. Grimwig with a motion towards the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cif he\u201d\u2014she pointed to Monks\u2014\u201chas been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say. I did sell them, and they\u2019re where you\u2019ll never get them. What then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cexcept that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again. You may leave the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: \u201cI hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed it will,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cYou may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all Mrs. Bumble. She would do it,\u201d urged Mr. Bumble; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is no excuse,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cYou were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the law supposes that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, \u201cthe law is a ass\u2014a idiot. If that\u2019s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience\u2014by experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his helpmate downstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung lady,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, \u201cgive me your hand. Do not tremble. You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf they have\u2014I do not know how they can, but if they have\u2014any reference to me,\u201d said Rose, \u201cpray let me hear them at some other time. I have not strength or spirits now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay,\u201d returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; \u201cyou have more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know this young lady, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw you before,\u201d said Rose faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen you often,\u201d returned Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe father of the unhappy Agnes had two daughters,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cWhat was the fate of the other\u2014the child?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe child,\u201d replied Monks, \u201cwhen her father died in a strange place, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced\u2014the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as their own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. \u201cGo on!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t find the spot to which these people had repaired,\u201d said Monks, \u201cbut where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way. My mother found it, after a year of cunning search\u2014ay, and found the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe took it, did she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. The people were poor and began to sicken\u2014at least the man did\u2014of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never meant to send. She didn\u2019t quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child\u2019s unhappiness, but told the history of the sister\u2019s shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other. The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home. There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy. I lost sight of her, two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you see her now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Leaning on your arm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not the less my niece,\u201d cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting girl in her arms; \u201cnot the less my dearest child. I would not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world. My sweet companion, my own dear girl!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe only friend I ever had,\u201d cried Rose, clinging to her. \u201cThe kindest, best of friends. My heart will burst. I cannot bear all this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, embracing her tenderly. \u201cCome, come, my love, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here\u2014look, look, my dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot aunt,\u201d cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; \u201cI\u2019ll never call her aunt\u2014sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling Rose!\u201d\r\n\r\nLet the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred. A father, sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment. Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain.\r\n\r\nThey were a long, long time alone. A soft tap at the door, at length announced that some one was without. Oliver opened it, glided away, and gave place to Harry Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it all,\u201d he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl. \u201cDear Rose, I know it all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not here by accident,\u201d he added after a lengthened silence; \u201cnor have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday\u2014only yesterday. Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStay,\u201d said Rose. \u201cYou do know all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll. You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject of our last discourse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to press you to alter your determination,\u201d pursued the young man, \u201cbut to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,\u201d said Rose firmly. \u201cIf I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night? It is a struggle,\u201d said Rose, \u201cbut one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe disclosure of to-night,\u201d\u2014Harry began.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe disclosure of to-night,\u201d replied Rose softly, \u201cleaves me in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou harden your heart against me, Rose,\u201d urged her lover.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Harry, Harry,\u201d said the young lady, bursting into tears; \u201cI wish I could, and spare myself this pain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why inflict it on yourself?\u201d said Harry, taking her hand. \u201cThink, dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what have I heard! What have I heard!\u201d cried Rose. \u201cThat a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all\u2014there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet, not yet,\u201d said the young man, detaining her as she rose. \u201cMy hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my love for you: have undergone a change. I offer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a home\u2014a heart and home\u2014yes, dearest Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean!\u201d she faltered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean but this\u2014that when I left you last, I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it. This I have done. Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right. Such power and patronage: such relatives of influence and rank: as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in England\u2019s richest county; and by one village church\u2014mine, Rose, my own!\u2014there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold. This is my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time. Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could offer a word in extenuation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, \u201cfor I began to think I should get nothing else. I\u2019ll take the liberty, if you\u2019ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal: he being young and a clergyman.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver, my child,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cwhere have you been, and why do you look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this moment. What is the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.\r\n\r\nPoor Dick was dead!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nFAGIN\u2019S LAST NIGHT ALIVE\r\n\r\nThe court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man\u2014Fagin. Before him and behind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury. At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf. Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot. He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still.\r\n\r\nA slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking round, he saw that the jurymen had turned together, to consider their verdict. As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence. A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay. But in no one face\u2014not even among the women, of whom there were many there\u2014could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned.\r\n\r\nAs he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge. Hush!\r\n\r\nThey only sought permission to retire.\r\n\r\nHe looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless. The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair. The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.\r\n\r\nHe looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot. There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book. He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it on. There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back. He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another.\r\n\r\nNot that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it. Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was. Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold\u2014and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it\u2014and then went on to think again.\r\n\r\nAt length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door. The jury returned, and passed him close. He could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone. Perfect stillness ensued\u2014not a rustle\u2014not a breath\u2014Guilty.\r\n\r\nThe building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder. It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old man\u2014an old man\u2014and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again.\r\n\r\nThe judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve. His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away. He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThey led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard. There was nobody there to speak to him; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed. He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.\r\n\r\nHere, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the condemned cells, and left him there\u2014alone.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word. These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered. To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead\u2014that was the end. To be hanged by the neck till he was dead.\r\n\r\nAs it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them. He had seen some of them die,\u2014and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips. With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes!\r\n\r\nSome of them might have inhabited that very cell\u2014sat upon that very spot. It was very dark; why didn\u2019t they bring a light? The cell had been built for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last hours there. It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies\u2014the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil.\u2014Light, light!\r\n\r\nAt length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more.\r\n\r\nThen came the night\u2014dark, dismal, silent night. Other watchers are glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day. To him they brought despair. The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound\u2014Death. What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.\r\n\r\nThe day passed off. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as come\u2014and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours. At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair. Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with curses. They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off.\r\n\r\nSaturday night. He had only one night more to live. And as he thought of this, the day broke\u2014Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention. He had sat there, awake, but dreaming. Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they\u2014used to such sights\u2014recoiled from him with horror. He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.\r\n\r\nHe cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight\u2014nine\u2014then. If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other\u2019s heels, where would he be, when they came round again! Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate. At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven\u2014\r\n\r\nThose dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that. The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him.\r\n\r\nFrom early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received. These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene. By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.\r\n\r\nThe space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately admitted into the lodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the young gentleman to come too, sir?\u201d said the man whose duty it was to conduct them. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sight for children, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not indeed, my friend,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \u201cbut my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well\u2014even at the cost of some pain and fear\u2014that he should see him now.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver. The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence\u2014\u201cthis is the place he passes through. If you step this way, you can see the door he goes out at.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door. There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men\u2019s voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards. They were putting up the scaffold.\r\n\r\nFrom this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand. Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell. They did so.\r\n\r\nThe condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man. His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy, Charley\u2014well done\u2014\u201d he mumbled. \u201cOliver, too, ha! ha! ha! Oliver too\u2014quite the gentleman now\u2014quite the\u2014take that boy away to bed!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake him away to bed!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cDo you hear me, some of you? He has been the\u2014the\u2014somehow the cause of all this. It\u2019s worth the money to bring him up to it\u2014Bolter\u2019s throat, Bill; never mind the girl\u2014Bolter\u2019s throat as deep as you can cut. Saw his head off!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin,\u201d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial. \u201cAn old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down. \u201cHere\u2019s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shan\u2019t be one long,\u201d he replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror. \u201cStrike them all dead! What right have they to butcher me?\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there.\r\n\r\n\u201cSteady,\u201d said the turnkey, still holding him down. \u201cNow, sir, tell him what you want. Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have some papers,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow advancing, \u201cwhich were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a lie together,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cI haven\u2019t one\u2014not one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the love of God,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, \u201cdo not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain. Where are those papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver,\u201d cried Fagin, beckoning to him. \u201cHere, here! Let me whisper to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not afraid,\u201d said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe papers,\u201d said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, \u201care in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I want to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d returned Oliver. \u201cLet me say a prayer. Do! Let me say one prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOutside, outside,\u201d replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head. \u201cSay I\u2019ve gone to sleep\u2014they\u2019ll believe you. You can get me out, if you take me so. Now then, now then!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! God forgive this wretched man!\u201d cried the boy with a burst of tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cThat\u2019ll help us on. This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don\u2019t you mind, but hurry on. Now, now, now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you nothing else to ask him, sir?\u201d inquired the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo other question,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cIf I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing will do that, sir,\u201d replied the man, shaking his head. \u201cYou had better leave him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.\r\n\r\n\u201cPress on, press on,\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cSoftly, but not so slow. Faster, faster!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held him back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before they left the prison. Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk.\r\n\r\nDay was dawning when they again emerged. A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking. Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all\u2014the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\nAND LAST\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed. The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words.\r\n\r\nBefore three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman\u2019s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know\u2014the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds. By the provisions of his father\u2019s will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded.\r\n\r\nMonks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison. As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin\u2019s gang.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver\u2019s warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world.\r\n\r\nSoon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor\u2019s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered. Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity. In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority.\r\n\r\nBefore his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one. On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman\u2019s face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so. It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.\r\n\r\nMr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work. After some consideration, he went into business as an informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence. His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire. The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others. Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong.\r\n\r\nMaster Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes\u2019s crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action. He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer\u2019s drudge, and a carrier\u2019s lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures.\r\n\r\nI would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister\u2019s child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye. These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech\u2014I would fain recall them every one.\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become\u2014how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing\u2014how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them\u2014these are all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.\r\n\r\nWithin the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: \u201cAGNES.\u201d There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love\u2014the love beyond the grave\u2014of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OLIVER TWIST ***\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for drawing the veil from men\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\r\n\r\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\r\n\r\nOne night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\u2014I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\r\n\r\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. \u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it said, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhat do you imagine that it means?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201cSuch paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a \u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d with a small \u201ct\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands for \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019 which is the German for \u2018Company.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like our \u2018Co.\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \u2018Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from all quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of the window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\r\n\r\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said he, \u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor. \u201cThe august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.\r\n\r\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI should be better able to advise you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \u201cYou are right,\u201d he cried; \u201cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can understand,\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \u201cyou can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray consult,\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\u201d murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto\u2014hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\u2014yes! Retired from operatic stage\u2014ha! Living in London\u2014quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. But how\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is the writing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy private note-paper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy own seal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImitated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was mad\u2014insane.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have tried and failed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not sell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sign of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely none.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed. \u201cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a very serious one to me,\u201d returned the King reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo ruin me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am about to be married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Irene Adler?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go\u2014none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, then we have three days yet,\u201d said Holmes with a yawn. \u201cThat is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, as to money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have carte blanche.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd for present expenses?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\u2019s Wood.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes took a note of it. \u201cOne other question,\u201d said he. \u201cWas the photograph a cabinet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\u201d he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \u201cIf you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\u2019clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\u201d\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend\u2019s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really!\u201d he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o\u2019clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\u2019s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am following you closely,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\u2014evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \u2018Drive like the devil,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018first to Gross & Hankey\u2019s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\u2019t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Church of St. Monica, John,\u2019 she cried, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. \u2018The Church of St. Monica,\u2019 said I, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy cabby drove fast. I don\u2019t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he cried. \u2018You\u2019ll do. Come! Come!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What then?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\u2019t be legal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\u201d said I; \u201cand what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \u2018I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\u2019 she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\u201d he answered, ringing the bell. \u201cI have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be delighted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind breaking the law?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in a good cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the cause is excellent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I am your man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was sure that I might rely on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is it you wish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,\u201d he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \u201cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am to be neutral?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when I raise my hand\u2014so\u2014you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is nothing very formidable,\u201d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \u201cIt is an ordinary plumber\u2019s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may entirely rely on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \u201cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, indeed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\u2019s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it has twice been burgled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw! They did not know how to look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how will you look?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will get her to show me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she will refuse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is dead,\u201d cried several voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201d shouted another. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brave fellow,\u201d said a woman. \u201cThey would have had the lady\u2019s purse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\u2019s breathing now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!\u201d\r\n\r\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\r\n\r\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \u201cFire!\u201d The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill\u2014gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids\u2014joined in a general shriek of \u201cFire!\u201d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\u2019s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNothing could have been better. It is all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know where it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe showed me, as I told you she would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not wish to make a mystery,\u201d said he, laughing. \u201cThe matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat also I could fathom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did that help you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when will you call?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that voice before,\u201d said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. \u201cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\u201d\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have really got it!\u201d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have hopes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must have a cab.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my brougham is waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that will simplify matters.\u201d We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cIrene Adler is married,\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried! When?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut to whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she could not love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am in hopes that she does.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why in hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\u2019s plan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true. And yet\u2014! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!\u201d He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Mr. Holmes,\u201d answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. \u201cDo you mean that she has left England?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever to return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the papers?\u201d asked the King hoarsely. \u201cAll is lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see.\u201d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \u201cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\u201d My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\r\n    \u201cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\r\n    \u201cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\n\r\n\u201cVery truly yours,\r\n\u201cIRENE NORTON, n\u00e9e ADLER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a woman\u2014oh, what a woman!\u201d cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. \u201cDid I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\u201d said Holmes coldly. \u201cI am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\u2019s business to a more successful conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\u201d cried the King; \u201cnothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring\u2014\u201d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have but to name it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis photograph!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cIrene\u2019s photograph!\u201d he cried. \u201cCertainly, if you wish it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.\u201d He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\u2019s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\u201d he said cordially.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid that you were engaged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I am. Very much so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I can wait in the next room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry the settee,\u201d said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \u201cI know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\u201d I observed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\r\n\r\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\u2019s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \u201cBeyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It\u2019s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\u2019s carpenter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but China?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\u2019 scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \u201cWell, I never!\u201d said he. \u201cI thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI begin to think, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I make a mistake in explaining. \u2018Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\u2019 you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have got it now,\u201d he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. \u201cHere it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of \u00a3 4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o\u2019clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope\u2019s Court, Fleet Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth does this mean?\u201d I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. \u201cIt is a little off the beaten track, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said he. \u201cAnd now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \u201cI have a small pawnbroker\u2019s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It\u2019s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the name of this obliging youth?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\u2019s not such a youth, either. It\u2019s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ\u00e9 who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don\u2019t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he has his faults, too,\u201d said Mr. Wilson. \u201cNever was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he\u2019s a good worker. There\u2019s no vice in him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is still with you, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean\u2014that\u2019s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why that?\u2019 I asks.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why,\u2019 says he, \u2018here\u2019s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It\u2019s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\u2019 end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\u2019s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what is it, then?\u2019 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\u2019t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\u2019 he asked with his eyes open.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what are they worth?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\u2019s other occupations.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me all about it,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said he, showing me the advertisement, \u2018you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not so many as you might think,\u2019 he answered. \u2018You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\u2019s Court looked like a coster\u2019s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were\u2014straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,\u201d remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \u201cPray continue your very interesting statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\u2019 said my assistant, \u2018and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And he is admirably suited for it,\u2019 the other answered. \u2018He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\u2019 He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It would be injustice to hesitate,\u2019 said he. \u2018You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\u2019 With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. \u2018There is water in your eyes,\u2019 said he as he released me. \u2018I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler\u2019s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\u2019 He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My name,\u2019 said he, \u2018is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI answered that I had not.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis face fell immediately.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me!\u2019 he said gravely, \u2018that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018In the case of another,\u2019 said he, \u2018the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\u2019 said Vincent Spaulding. \u2018I should be able to look after that for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What would be the hours?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ten to two.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cNow a pawnbroker\u2019s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That would suit me very well,\u2019 said I. \u2018And the pay?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is \u00a3 4 a week.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is purely nominal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What do you call purely nominal?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don\u2019t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No excuse will avail,\u2019 said Mr. Duncan Ross; \u2018neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is to copy out the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\u2019 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope\u2019s Court.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o\u2019clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\u2019s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\u2019s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an end?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o\u2019clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:\r\n\r\n\u201cTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot see that there is anything very funny,\u201d cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \u201cIf you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018the gentleman at No. 4.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What, the red-headed man?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where could I find him?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul\u2019s.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you do then?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you did very wisely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGrave enough!\u201d said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \u201cWhy, I have lost four pound a week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as you are personally concerned,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cI do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some \u00a3 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank\u2014if it was a prank\u2014upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement\u2014how long had he been with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout a month then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did he come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn answer to an advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he the only applicant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I had a dozen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you pick him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he was handy and would come cheap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt half wages, in fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\u2019s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \u201cI thought as much,\u201d said he. \u201cHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum!\u201d said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \u201cHe is still with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing to complain of, sir. There\u2019s never very much to do of a morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Watson,\u201d said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \u201cwhat do you make of it all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI make nothing of it,\u201d I answered frankly. \u201cIt is a most mysterious business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a rule,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthe more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo smoke,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won\u2019t speak to me for fifty minutes.\u201d He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\u201cSarasate plays at the St. James\u2019s Hall this afternoon,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with \u201cJABEZ WILSON\u201d in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\u2019s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThird right, fourth left,\u201d answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cSmart fellow, that,\u201d observed Holmes as we walked away. \u201cHe is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvidently,\u201d said I, \u201cMr. Wilson\u2019s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe knees of his trousers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I expected to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you beat the pavement?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy\u2019s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \u201cI should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer\u2019s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\u2019s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we\u2019ve done our work, so it\u2019s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James\u2019s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\u201d he remarked as we emerged.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would be as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy serious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt what time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTen will be early enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be at Baker Street at ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\u201d He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\r\n\r\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclop\u00e6dia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\u2019s assistant was a formidable man\u2014a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! Our party is complete,\u201d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \u201cWatson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\u2019s adventure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\u201d said Jones in his consequential way. \u201cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\u201d observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\u201d said the police agent loftily. \u201cHe has his own little methods, which are, if he won\u2019t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\u201d said the stranger with deference. \u201cStill, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you will find,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cthat you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some \u00a3 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\u2019s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\u2019s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He\u2019ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I\u2019ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\u2019ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are close there now,\u201d my friend remarked. \u201cThis fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\u201d Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor from below,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \u201cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\u201d he remarked, looking up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\u201d said Holmes severely. \u201cYou have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have at least an hour before us,\u201d he remarked, \u201cfor they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor\u2014as no doubt you have divined\u2014in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is our French gold,\u201d whispered the director. \u201cWe have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour French gold?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich were very well justified,\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cAnd now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd sit in the dark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carr\u00e9e, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy\u2019s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\u201d\r\n\r\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness\u2014such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\u2019s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have but one retreat,\u201d whispered Holmes. \u201cThat is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\r\n\r\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\r\n\r\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all clear,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHave you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\u2019ll swing for it!\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\u2019 hunting crop came down on the man\u2019s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use, John Clay,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cYou have no chance at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I see,\u201d the other answered with the utmost coolness. \u201cI fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are three men waiting for him at the door,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I you,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cYour red-headed idea was very new and effective.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see your pal again presently,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\u201d remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \u201cYou may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \u2018sir\u2019 and \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \u201cWell, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is better,\u201d said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \u201cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Watson,\u201d he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \u201cit was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclop\u00e6dia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\u2019s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\u2019s hair. The \u00a3 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\u2019s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\u2019s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar\u2014something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend\u2019s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\u2019s presence\u2014in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou reasoned it out beautifully,\u201d I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. \u201cIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt saved me from ennui,\u201d he answered, yawning. \u201cAlas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are a benefactor of the race,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,\u201d he remarked. \u201c\u2018L\u2019homme c\u2019est rien\u2014l\u2019\u0153uvre c\u2019est tout,\u2019 as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\u201d\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nA CASE OF IDENTITY\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \u201clife is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outr\u00e9 results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,\u201d I answered. \u201cThe cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cThis is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\u201d\r\n\r\nI smiled and shook my head. \u201cI can quite understand your thinking so,\u201d I said. \u201cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here\u201d\u2014I picked up the morning paper from the ground\u2014\u201clet us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \u2018A husband\u2019s cruelty to his wife.\u2019 There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\u201d said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \u201cThis is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the ring?\u201d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd have you any on hand just now?\u201d I asked with interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen those symptoms before,\u201d said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. \u201cOscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de c\u0153ur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not find,\u201d he said, \u201cthat with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did at first,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut now I know where the letters are without looking.\u201d Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,\u201d she cried, \u201celse how could you know all that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Holmes, laughing; \u201cit is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\u2019m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \u201cYes, I did bang out of the house,\u201d she said, \u201cfor it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\u2014that is, my father\u2014took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyour stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your mother is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\u2019t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father\u2019s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got \u00a3 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\u2019t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour own little income,\u201d he asked, \u201cdoes it come out of the business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4\u00bd per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou interest me extremely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAnd since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about \u00a3 60.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don\u2019t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have made your position very clear to me,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\u2019s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. \u201cI met him first at the gasfitters\u2019 ball,\u201d she said. \u201cThey used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\u2019s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Then at the gasfitters\u2019 ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him\u2014that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know father didn\u2019t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\u2019t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer\u2014Mr. Angel\u2014was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat office?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did he live, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe slept on the premises.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know his address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014except that it was Leadenhall Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you address your letters, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\u2019t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was most suggestive,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\u2019d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn\u2019t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\u2019t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt missed him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\u2019s, near King\u2019s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father? Did you tell him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\u2019t sleep a wink at night.\u201d She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall glance into the case for you,\u201d said Holmes, rising, \u201cand I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see him again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what has happened to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI advertised for him in last Saturday\u2019s Chronicle,\u201d said she. \u201cHere is the slip and here are four letters from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. And your address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Angel\u2019s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father\u2019s place of business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,\u201d he observed. \u201cI found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in \u201977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman\u2019s appearance? Describe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn\u2019t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman\u2019s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt surprised me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what else?\u201d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend\u2019s incisive reasoning.\r\n\r\n\u201cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\nI held the little printed slip to the light. \u201cMissing,\u201d it said, \u201con the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,\u201d &c, &c.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAs to the letters,\u201d he continued, glancing over them, \u201cthey are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are typewritten,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little \u2018Hosmer Angel\u2019 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive\u2014in fact, we may call it conclusive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady\u2019s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o\u2019clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\u2019s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\r\n\r\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\r\n\r\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o\u2019clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the d\u00e9nouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, have you solved it?\u201d I asked as I entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, the mystery!\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the girl\u2019s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o\u2019clock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes quietly; \u201cI have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \u201cI am delighted to hear it,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a curious thing,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cthat a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man\u2019s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the \u2018e,\u2019 and a slight defect in the tail of the \u2018r.\u2019 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,\u201d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,\u201d Holmes continued. \u201cI think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the \u2018e\u2019s\u2019 slurred and the \u2018r\u2019s\u2019 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \u201cI cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. \u201cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! where?\u201d shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it won\u2019t do\u2014really it won\u2019t,\u201d said Holmes suavely. \u201cThere is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\u2019s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. \u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s not actionable,\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\u201d said he, \u201cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\u2019s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was only a joke at first,\u201d groaned our visitor. \u201cWe never thought that she would have been so carried away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\u2019s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\u2019s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\u2019s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cbut if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,\u201d said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, \u201cyet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\u201d he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\u2019s face, \u201cit is not part of my duties to my client, but here\u2019s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to\u2014\u201d He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\u201d said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. \u201cThat fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you verify them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise\u2014the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ\u00e9, James Windibank. Voil\u00e0 tout!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Miss Sutherland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, \u2018There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\u2019 There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nTHE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\r\n\r\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you say, dear?\u201d said my wife, looking across at me. \u201cWill you go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 cases.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you heard anything of the case?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat sounds a little paradoxical.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a murder, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\u2014a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\u2019s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of \u2018wilful murder\u2019 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,\u201d I remarked. \u201cIf ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\u201d answered Holmes thoughtfully. \u201cIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said I, \u201cthat the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\u201d he answered, laughing. \u201cBesides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my m\u00e9tier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner\u2019s jury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a confession,\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cit is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cMany men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the young man\u2019s own account of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: \u2018I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \u201cCooee!\u201d which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner\u2019s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I should prefer not to answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I must still refuse.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of \u2018Cooee\u2019 was a common signal between you and your father?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It was.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: Nothing definite.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What do you mean?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, it was gone.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018You cannot say what it was?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I had a feeling something was there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How far from the body?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018A dozen yards or so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And how far from the edge of the wood?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018About the same.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but with my back towards it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis concluded the examination of the witness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said I as I glanced down the column, \u201cthat the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\u2019s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. \u201cBoth you and the coroner have been at some pains,\u201d said he, \u201cto single out the very strongest points in the young man\u2019s favour. Don\u2019t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr\u00e9 as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly four o\u2019clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have ordered a carriage,\u201d said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. \u201cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cIt is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade looked startled. \u201cI do not quite follow,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \u201cYou have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can\u2019t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\u201d she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman\u2019s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, \u201cI am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\u2019t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou may rely upon my doing all that I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that it is very probable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, now!\u201d she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. \u201cYou hear! He gives me hopes.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and\u2014and\u2014well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cWas he in favour of such a union?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.\u201d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for this information,\u201d said he. \u201cMay I see your father if I call to-morrow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid the doctor won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! In Victoria! That is important.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, at the mines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, Miss Turner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\u201d She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\u201d said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes\u2019 silence. \u201cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHave you an order to see him in prison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but only for you and me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmple.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man\u2019s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\u2019s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\u2019 attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\u2019s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\u2019 insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy\u2019s innocence.\r\n\r\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe glass still keeps very high,\u201d he remarked as he sat down. \u201cIt is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you learn from him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould he throw no light?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot admire his taste,\u201d I remarked, \u201cif it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o\u2019clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is serious news this morning,\u201d Lestrade observed. \u201cIt is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn elderly man, I presume?\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\u2019s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! That is interesting,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\u2019s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,\u201d said Lestrade, winking at me. \u201cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Holmes demurely; \u201cyou do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,\u201d replied Lestrade with some warmth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is it.\u201d It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\u2019 request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son\u2019s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\r\n\r\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\u2019s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you go into the pool for?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.\u201d He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. \u201cThese are young McCarthy\u2019s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father\u2019s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again\u2014of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\u201d He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been a case of considerable interest,\u201d he remarked, returning to his natural manner. \u201cI fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis may interest you, Lestrade,\u201d he remarked, holding it out. \u201cThe murder was done with it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see no marks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the murderer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed. \u201cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\u201d he said. \u201cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNous verrons,\u201d answered Holmes calmly. \u201cYou work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd leave your case unfinished?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the mystery?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is solved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was the criminal, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gentleman I describe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am a practical man,\u201d he said, \u201cand I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cI have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Watson,\u201d he said when the cloth was cleared \u201cjust sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\u2019t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy\u2019s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\u2019s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of this \u2018Cooee!\u2019 then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The \u2018Cooee!\u2019 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But \u2018Cooee\u2019 is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of the rat, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. \u201cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\u201d he said. \u201cI wired to Bristol for it last night.\u201d He put his hand over part of the map. \u201cWhat do you read?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cARAT,\u201d I read.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d He raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cBALLARAT.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son\u2019s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how did you gain them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they were peculiar boots.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his lameness?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\u2014he was lame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his left-handedness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the cigar-holder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. John Turner,\u201d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray sit down on the sofa,\u201d said Holmes gently. \u201cYou had my note?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why did you wish to see me?\u201d He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \u201cIt is so. I know all about McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \u201cGod help me!\u201d he cried. \u201cBut I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad to hear you say so,\u201d said Holmes gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart\u2014it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may not come to that,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a dying man,\u201d said old Turner. \u201cI have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. \u201cJust tell us the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as well,\u201d said the old man; \u201cit\u2019s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I\u2019ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in the early \u201960\u2019s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Here we are, Jack,\u2019 says he, touching me on the arm; \u2018we\u2019ll be as good as a family to you. There\u2019s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there\u2019s always a policeman within hail.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is not for me to judge you,\u201d said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. \u201cI pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFarewell, then,\u201d said the old man solemnly. \u201cYour own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.\u201d Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod help us!\u201d said Holmes after a long silence. \u201cWhy does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter\u2019s words, and say, \u2018There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\r\n\r\nV.\r\nTHE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\r\n\r\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years \u201982 and \u201990, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.\r\n\r\nThe year \u201987 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\u2019s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\u2014a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell\u2019s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\u2019s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said I, glancing up at my companion, \u201cthat was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept yourself I have none,\u201d he answered. \u201cI do not encourage visitors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA client, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. \u201cI trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me your coat and umbrella,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, from Horsham.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come for advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is easily got.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not always so easy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said that you could solve anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said too much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you are never beaten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been beaten four times\u2014three times by men, and once by a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true that I have been generally successful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may be so with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no ordinary one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou fill me with interest,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d said he, \u201cis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know that my grandfather had two sons\u2014my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\u2019s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\u2019s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day\u2014it was in March, 1883\u2014a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\u2019s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \u2018From India!\u2019 said he as he took it up, \u2018Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\u2019 Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, \u2018K. K. K.!\u2019 he shrieked, and then, \u2018My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What is it, uncle?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Death,\u2019 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018They may do what they like, but I\u2019ll checkmate them still,\u2019 said he with an oath. \u2018Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish you, John,\u2019 said my uncle, \u2018to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\u2019t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \u2018suicide.\u2019 But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some \u00a3 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Holmes interposed, \u201cyour statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. Pray proceed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and \u2018Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\u2019 written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\u2019s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was the beginning of \u201984 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of \u201985. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\u2019 he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy heart had turned to lead. \u2018It is K. K. K.,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked inside the envelope. \u2018So it is,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Put the papers on the sundial,\u2019 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What papers? What sundial?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\u2019 said I; \u2018but the papers must be those that are destroyed.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Pooh!\u2019 said he, gripping hard at his courage. \u2018We are in a civilised land here, and we can\u2019t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018From Dundee,\u2019 I answered, glancing at the postmark.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Some preposterous practical joke,\u2019 said he. \u2018What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should certainly speak to the police,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then let me do so?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I forbid you. I won\u2019t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \u2018death from accidental causes.\u2019 Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\u2019s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in January, \u201985, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the envelope,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe postmark is London\u2014eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father\u2019s last message: \u2018K. K. K.\u2019; and then \u2018Put the papers on the sundial.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell the truth\u201d\u2014he sank his face into his thin, white hands\u2014\u201cI have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut! tut!\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \u201cIncredible imbecility!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he come with you to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. His orders were to stay in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d he said, \u201cand, above all, why did you not come at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us\u2014no suggestive detail which might help us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one thing,\u201d said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \u201cI have some remembrance,\u201d said he, \u201cthat on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, \u201cMarch, 1869,\u201d and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\r\n\r\n\u201c4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\r\n\r\n\u201c7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\u201c9th. McCauley cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201c10th. John Swain cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201c12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. \u201cAnd now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. \u201cYou have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy train from Waterloo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am armed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall see you at Horsham, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\u201d He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements\u2014blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\u2014and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, Watson,\u201d he remarked at last, \u201cthat of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut have you,\u201d I asked, \u201cformed any definite conception as to what these perils are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere can be no question as to their nature,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \u201cThe ideal reasoner,\u201d he remarked, \u201cwould, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclop\u00e6dias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, laughing. \u201cIt was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclop\u00e6dia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom East London. What do you deduce from that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability\u2014the strong probability\u2014is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA greater distance to travel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I do not see the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\u2019s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut of what society?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you never\u2014\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice\u2014\u201chave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never have.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \u201cHere it is,\u201d said he presently:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape\u2014a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will observe,\u201d said Holmes, laying down the volume, \u201cthat the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the page we have seen\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \u2018sent the pips to A, B, and C\u2019\u2014that is, sent the society\u2019s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me for not waiting for you,\u201d said he; \u201cI have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat steps will you take?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not go there first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou are too late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said he, laying down his cup, \u201cI feared as much. How was it done?\u201d He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \u2018Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\u2019 Here is the account:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\u2014!\u201d He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must be cunning devils,\u201d he exclaimed at last. \u201cHow could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\u2019clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are hungry,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how have you succeeded?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a clue?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \u201cS. H. for J. O.\u201d Then he sealed it and addressed it to \u201cCaptain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will await him when he enters port,\u201d said he, chuckling. \u201cIt may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is this Captain Calhoun?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you trace it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have spent the whole day,\u201d said he, \u201cover Lloyd\u2019s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \u201983. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTexas, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, \u201985, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you do, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \u201cL. S.\u201d carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nTHE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\r\n\r\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George\u2019s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey\u2019s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\r\n\r\nOne night\u2014it was in June, \u201989\u2014there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201cA patient!\u201d said she. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go out.\u201d\r\n\r\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\r\n\r\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my calling so late,\u201d she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife\u2019s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \u201cOh, I\u2019m in such trouble!\u201d she cried; \u201cI do so want a little help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said my wife, pulling up her veil, \u201cit is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\u201d That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, no! I want the doctor\u2019s advice and help, too. It\u2019s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\u2019s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\r\n\r\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\r\n\r\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\u2019s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.\r\n\r\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\r\n\r\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I have not come to stay,\u201d said I. \u201cThere is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! It\u2019s Watson,\u201d said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \u201cI say, Watson, what o\u2019clock is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNearly eleven.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf Friday, June 19th.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\u2019you want to frighten a chap for?\u201d He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I am. But you\u2019ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes\u2014I forget how many. But I\u2019ll go home with you. I wouldn\u2019t frighten Kate\u2014poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have one waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, \u201cWalk past me, and then look back at me.\u201d The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes!\u201d I whispered, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing in this den?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs low as you can,\u201d he answered; \u201cI have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a cab outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\u2019s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was certainly surprised to find you there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not more so than I to find you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to find a friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I to find an enemy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn enemy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour\u2019s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul\u2019s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! You do not mean bodies?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had \u00a3 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\u201d He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\u2014a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\u2019 hoofs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I can be of use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Cedars?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; that is Mr. St. Clair\u2019s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNear Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am all in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you are. You\u2019ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here\u2019s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt makes you quite invaluable as a companion. \u2019Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget that I know nothing about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There\u2019s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\u2019t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I\u2019ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProceed, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome years ago\u2014to be definite, in May, 1884\u2014there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to \u00a3 88 10s., while he has \u00a3 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\u2019s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\r\n\r\n\u201cConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps\u2014for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night\u2014and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children\u2019s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\u2014all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\u2019s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a cripple!\u201d said I. \u201cWhat could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray continue your narrative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\u2019s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies\u2014421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat\u2019s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt certainly sounds feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\u2014what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance\u2014are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are on the outskirts of Lee,\u201d said my companion. \u201cWe have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse\u2019s feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\u2019s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d she cried, \u201cwell?\u201d And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo good news?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo bad?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am delighted to see you,\u201d said she, pressing my hand warmly. \u201cYou will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear madam,\u201d said I, \u201cI am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, \u201cI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon what point?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \u201cFrankly, now!\u201d she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrankly, then, madam, I do not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think that he is dead?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMurdered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t say that. Perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on what day did he meet his death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he roared.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, to-day.\u201d She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoarse writing,\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cSurely this is not your husband\u2019s writing, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but the enclosure is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can you tell that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are sure that this is your husband\u2019s hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.\u2014NEVILLE.\u2019 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband\u2019s hand, madam?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone. Neville wrote those words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, much may have happened between.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the window open?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he might have called to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA call for help, you thought?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He waved his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you thought he was pulled back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe disappeared so suddenly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\r\n\r\n\u201cAwake, Watson?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGame for a morning drive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\u201d He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\r\n\r\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to test a little theory of mine,\u201d said he, pulling on his boots. \u201cI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd where is it?\u201d I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d he answered. \u201cOh, yes, I am not joking,\u201d he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. \u201cI have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been in some points a singular case,\u201d said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. \u201cI confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse\u2019s head while the other led us in.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is on duty?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\u201d A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \u201cI wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI called about that beggarman, Boone\u2014the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I heard. You have him here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the cells.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he quiet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDirty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker\u2019s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to see him very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I think that I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Come this way, if you please.\u201d He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe third on the right is his,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHere it is!\u201d He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is asleep,\u201d said he. \u201cYou can see him very well.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe certainly needs a wash,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cI had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\u201d He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe! he! You are a funny one,\u201d chuckled the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why not,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\u201d He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d he shouted, \u201cto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.\u201d\r\n\r\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\u2019s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat heavens!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cit is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. \u201cBe it so,\u201d said he. \u201cAnd pray what am I charged with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith making away with Mr. Neville St.\u2014 Oh, come, you can\u2019t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\u201d said the inspector with a grin. \u201cWell, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not the wife; it was the children,\u201d groaned the prisoner. \u201cGod help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\u201d said he, \u201cof course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you!\u201d cried the prisoner passionately. \u201cI would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for \u00a3 25. I was at my wit\u2019s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight\u2019s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at \u00a3 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn \u00a3 700 a year\u2014which is less than my average takings\u2014but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take \u00a3 2.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife\u2019s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat note only reached her yesterday,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God! What a week she must have spent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe police have watched this Lascar,\u201d said Inspector Bradstreet, \u201cand I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \u201cI have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMany times; but what was a fine to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must stop here, however,\u201d said Bradstreet. \u201cIf the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reached this one,\u201d said my friend, \u201cby sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are engaged,\u201d said I; \u201cperhaps I interrupt you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\u201d\u2014he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat\u2014\u201cbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\u201d\r\n\r\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. \u201cI suppose,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\u2014that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no. No crime,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cOnly one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much so,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is to him that this trophy belongs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is his hat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\u2019s fire. The facts are these: about four o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\u2019s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich surely he restored to their owner?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \u2018For Mrs. Henry Baker\u2019 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\u2019s left leg, and it is also true that the initials \u2018H. B.\u2019 are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, then, did Peterson do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he not advertise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly as much as we can deduce.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom his hat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker\u2019s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \u201cH. B.\u201d were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can see nothing,\u201d said I, handing it back to my friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. \u201cIt is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,\u201d he remarked, \u201cand yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\u201d he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. \u201cHe is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt is a question of cubic capacity,\u201d said he; \u201ca man with so large a brain must have something in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe decline of his fortunes, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \u201cHere is the foresight,\u201d said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. \u201cThey are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his wife\u2014you said that she had ceased to love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week\u2019s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\u2019s affection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he might be a bachelor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird\u2019s leg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow\u2014walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is very ingenious,\u201d said I, laughing; \u201cbut since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?\u201d Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man\u2019s excited face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\u201d He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \u201cBy Jove, Peterson!\u201d said he, \u201cthis is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the Countess of Morcar\u2019s blue carbuncle!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of \u00a3 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\u201d The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\u2019s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.\u201d He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\u201cHotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\u2019s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! So much for the police-court,\u201d said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. \u201cThe question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \u2018Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.\u2019 That is clear and concise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery. But will he see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn which, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James\u2019s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, sir. And this stone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. \u201cIt\u2019s a bonny thing,\u201d said he. \u201cJust see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil\u2019s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I\u2019ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you can do nothing until then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes\u2019 room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Henry Baker, I believe,\u201d said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. \u201cPray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes\u2019 surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have retained these things for some days,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cbecause we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \u201cShillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo eat it!\u201d Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, certainly,\u201d answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cThey might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,\u201d said he, \u201cbut beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,\u201d said he. \u201cBy the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. \u201cThere are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum\u2014we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\u201d With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for Mr. Henry Baker,\u201d said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. \u201cIt is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors\u2019 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy geese!\u201d The man seemed surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\u2019s not our geese.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! Whose, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBreckinridge is his name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I don\u2019t know him. Well, here\u2019s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow for Mr. Breckinridge,\u201d he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. \u201cRemember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years\u2019 penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening. It\u2019s a cold night,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cSold out of geese, I see,\u201d continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but I was recommended to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho by?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe landlord of the Alpha.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, mister,\u201d said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, \u201cwhat are you driving at? Let\u2019s have it straight, now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then, I shan\u2019t tell you. So now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\u2019t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWarm! You\u2019d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it\u2019s \u2018Where are the geese?\u2019 and \u2018Who did you sell the geese to?\u2019 and \u2018What will you take for the geese?\u2019 One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,\u201d said Holmes carelessly. \u201cIf you won\u2019t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I\u2019m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, you\u2019ve lost your fiver, for it\u2019s town bred,\u201d snapped the salesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never persuade me to believe that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you bet, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\u2019ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \u201cBring me the books, Bill,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, Mr. Cocksure,\u201d said the salesman, \u201cI thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you\u2019ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\u2019you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\u2014249,\u201d read Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \u201cHere you are, \u2018Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, what\u2019s the last entry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. There you are. And underneath?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you to say now?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \u2018Pink \u2019un\u2019 protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\u201d said he. \u201cI daresay that if I had put \u00a3 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you and your geese,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I\u2019ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I\u2019ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; but one of them was mine all the same,\u201d whined the little man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe told me to ask you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\u2019ve had enough of it. Get out of this!\u201d He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\u201d whispered Holmes. \u201cCome with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\u201d Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you, then? What do you want?\u201d he asked in a quavering voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me,\u201d said Holmes blandly, \u201cbut I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can know nothing of this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\u201d cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \u201cI can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \u201cIn that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,\u201d said he. \u201cBut pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \u201cMy name is John Robinson,\u201d he answered with a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; the real name,\u201d said Holmes sweetly. \u201cIt is always awkward doing business with an alias.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \u201cWell then,\u201d said he, \u201cmy real name is James Ryder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. \u201cThe fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested\u2014white, with a black bar across the tail.\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder quivered with emotion. \u201cOh, sir,\u201d he cried, \u201ccan you tell me where it went to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt came here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\u2019t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead\u2014the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe game\u2019s up, Ryder,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cHold up, man, or you\u2019ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\u2019s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\u201d said he in a crackling voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see\u2014her ladyship\u2019s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady\u2019s room\u2014you and your confederate Cusack\u2014and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion\u2019s knees. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cThink of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\u2019ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don\u2019t bring it into court! For Christ\u2019s sake, don\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet back into your chair!\u201d said Holmes sternly. \u201cIt is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \u201cI will tell you it just as it happened, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister\u2019s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds\u2014a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\u2019 says she.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018you said you\u2019d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 says she, \u2018we\u2019ve set yours aside for you\u2014Jem\u2019s bird, we call it. It\u2019s the big white one over yonder. There\u2019s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thank you, Maggie,\u2019 says I; \u2018but if it is all the same to you, I\u2019d rather have that one I was handling just now.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The other is a good three pound heavier,\u2019 said she, \u2018and we fattened it expressly for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never mind. I\u2019ll have the other, and I\u2019ll take it now,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, just as you like,\u2019 said she, a little huffed. \u2018Which is it you want, then?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\u2019s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where are they all, Maggie?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Gone to the dealer\u2019s, Jem.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Which dealer\u2019s?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But was there another with a barred tail?\u2019 I asked, \u2018the same as the one I chose?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now\u2014and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!\u201d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more words. Get out!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, \u201cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.\u201d\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\r\n\r\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was early in April in the year \u201983 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut it\u2019s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then\u2014a fire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-morning, madam,\u201d said Holmes cheerily. \u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not cold which makes me shiver,\u201d said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\u201d She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not fear,\u201d said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. \u201cWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know me, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no mystery, my dear madam,\u201d said he, smiling. \u201cThe left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\u201d said she. \u201cI started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to\u2014none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\r\n\r\n\u201cFarintosh,\u201d said he. \u201cAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas!\u201d replied our visitor, \u201cthe very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am all attention, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes nodded his head. \u201cThe name is familiar to me,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother\u2019s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money\u2014not less than \u00a3 1000 a year\u2014and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died\u2014she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather\u2019s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister is dead, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\u2019s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady\u2019s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray be precise as to details,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\u2019s, the second my sister\u2019s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\u2019clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, Helen,\u2019 said she, \u2018have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not. But why?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from\u2014perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\u2019 She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister\u2019s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister\u2019s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, \u2018Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\u2019 There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor\u2019s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister\u2019s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d said Holmes, \u201care you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas your sister dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\u2019s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about poison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there are nearly always some there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\u2014a speckled band?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are very deep waters,\u201d said he; \u201cpray go on with your narrative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage\u2014Percy Armitage\u2014the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done wisely,\u201d said my friend. \u201cBut have you told me all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor\u2019s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been cruelly used,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \u201cHe is a hard man,\u201d she said, \u201cand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very deep business,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThere are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o\u2019clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.\u201d She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDark enough and sinister enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter\u2019s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what, then, did the gipsies do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see many objections to any such theory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich of you is Holmes?\u201d asked this apparition.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\u201d said my companion quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, Doctor,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cPray take a seat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a little cold for the time of the year,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has she been saying to you?\u201d screamed the old man furiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\u201d continued my companion imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! You put me off, do you?\u201d said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. \u201cI know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes, the busybody!\u201d\r\n\r\nHis smile broadened.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \u201cYour conversation is most entertaining,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will go when I have had my say. Don\u2019t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\u201d He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,\u201d he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems a very amiable person,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cI am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\u201d As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\r\n\r\n\u201cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\u2019 Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,\u201d said he. \u201cTo determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife\u2019s death was little short of \u00a3 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than \u00a3 750. Each daughter can claim an income of \u00a3 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning\u2019s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley\u2019s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook there!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\r\n\r\n\u201cStoke Moran?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\u201d remarked the driver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is some building going on there,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthat is where we are going.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the village,\u201d said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; \u201cbut if you want to get to the house, you\u2019ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\u201d observed Holmes, shading his eyes. \u201cYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought it as well,\u201d said Holmes as we climbed the stile, \u201cthat this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. \u201cI have been waiting so eagerly for you,\u201d she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \u201cAll has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have had the pleasure of making the Doctor\u2019s acquaintance,\u201d said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d she cried, \u201che has followed me, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it appears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\u2019s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister\u2019s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott\u2019s chamber?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \u201cHum!\u201d said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \u201cmy theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere does that bell communicate with?\u201d he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt goes to the housekeeper\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks newer than the other things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.\u201d He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a dummy,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t it ring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery strange!\u201d muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \u201cThere are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is also quite modern,\u201d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey seem to have been of a most interesting character\u2014dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d he asked, tapping the safe.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy stepfather\u2019s business papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you have seen inside, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a cat in it, for example?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. What a strange idea!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, look at this!\u201d He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; we don\u2019t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\u201d He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. That is quite settled,\u201d said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. \u201cHullo! Here is something interesting!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common enough lash. But I don\u2019t know why it should be tied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\u2019s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had never seen my friend\u2019s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall most certainly do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI assure you that I am in your hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is the Crown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Your windows would be visible from there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, easily.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe rest you will leave in our hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what will you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\u201d said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\u2019s sleeve.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for pity\u2019s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\u2019s death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor\u2019s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, \u201cI have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I be of assistance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour presence might be invaluable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall certainly come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very kind of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw the ventilator, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott\u2019s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\u2019s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what harm can there be in that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot as yet see any connection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope\u2014or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness\u2019 sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\u2019clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is our signal,\u201d said Holmes, springing to his feet; \u201cit comes from the middle window.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\r\n\r\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d I whispered; \u201cdid you see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a nice household,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat is the baboon.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes\u2019 example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\r\n\r\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\r\n\r\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible\u2014a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see it, Watson?\u201d he yelled. \u201cYou see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can it mean?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt means that it is all over,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cAnd perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe band! the speckled band!\u201d whispered Holmes.\r\n\r\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a swamp adder!\u201d cried Holmes; \u201cthe deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\u2019s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile\u2019s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm\u2019s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\r\n\r\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had,\u201d said he, \u201ccome to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word \u2018band,\u2019 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.\u201d\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\u2019S THUMB\r\n\r\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice\u2014that of Mr. Hatherley\u2019s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\u2019s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of \u201989, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\u2019clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got him here,\u201d he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; \u201che\u2019s all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new patient,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI thought I\u2019d bring him round myself; then he couldn\u2019t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\u201d And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\r\n\r\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took it up and glanced at it. \u201cMr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\u201d That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. \u201cI regret that I have kept you waiting,\u201d said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \u201cYou are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my night could not be called monotonous,\u201d said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d I cried; \u201cpull yourself together!\u201d and I poured out some water from a caraffe.\r\n\r\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been making a fool of myself,\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Drink this.\u201d I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried, \u201cthis is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! You should have been a surgeon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis has been done,\u201d said I, examining the wound, \u201cby a very heavy and sharp instrument.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA thing like a cleaver,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn accident, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! a murderous attack?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery murderous indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is that?\u201d I asked when I had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cCapital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d cried I, \u201cif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have heard of that fellow,\u201d answered my visitor, \u201cand I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do better. I\u2019ll take you round to him myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be immensely obliged to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.\u201d I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley,\u201d said he. \u201cPray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said my patient, \u201cbut I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\u2019s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to \u00a3 27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of \u2018Colonel Lysander Stark\u2019 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Hatherley?\u2019 said he, with something of a German accent. \u2018You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. \u2018May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That is quite correct,\u2019 I answered; \u2018but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential\u2014absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If I promise to keep a secret,\u2019 said I, \u2018you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you promise, then?\u2019 said he at last.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, I promise.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have already given you my word.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 said he, coming back. \u2018I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master\u2019s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.\u2019 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\r\n\r\n\u201cA feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I beg that you will state your business, sir,\u2019 said I; \u2018my time is of value.\u2019 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How would fifty guineas for a night\u2019s work suit you?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Most admirably.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I say a night\u2019s work, but an hour\u2019s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where to?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There is a drive, then?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said I, \u2018I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Entirely.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller\u2019s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have heard so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Some little time ago I bought a small place\u2014a very small place\u2014within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller\u2019s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left\u2014both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I quite follow you,\u2019 said I. \u2018The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller\u2019s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he carelessly, \u2018we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\u2019 He rose as he spoke. \u2018I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I shall certainly be there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And not a word to a soul.\u2019 He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller\u2019s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o\u2019clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne horse?\u201d interjected Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, only one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you observe the colour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTired-looking or fresh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, fresh and glossy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,\u2019 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. \u2018I shall not keep you waiting an instant,\u2019 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I would go,\u2019 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; \u2018I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But, madam,\u2019 said I, \u2018I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is not worth your while to wait,\u2019 she went on. \u2018You can pass through the door; no one hinders.\u2019 And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. \u2018For the love of Heaven!\u2019 she whispered, \u2018get away from here before it is too late!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is my secretary and manager,\u2019 said the colonel. \u2018By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018On the contrary,\u2019 said I, \u2018I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \u2018Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,\u2019 said he. \u2018Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no, it is in the house.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What, you dig fuller\u2019s-earth in the house?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWe went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\r\n\r\n\u201cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We are now,\u2019 said he, \u2018actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\u2019s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What are you doing there?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. \u2018I was admiring your fuller\u2019s-earth,\u2019 said I; \u2018I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018you shall know all about the machine.\u2019 He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 I yelled. \u2018Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come! come!\u2019 she cried breathlessly. \u2018They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit\u2019s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is your only chance,\u2019 said she. \u2018It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\u2019s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Fritz! Fritz!\u2019 she cried in English, \u2018remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are mad, Elise!\u2019 he shouted, struggling to break away from her. \u2018You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\u2019 He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\u2019s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is an advertisement which will interest you,\u201d said he. \u201cIt appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \u2018Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\u2019clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,\u2019 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried my patient. \u201cThen that explains what the girl said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said he. \u201cThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was an hour\u2019s good drive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I cannot understand,\u201d said I, \u201cis why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman\u2019s entreaties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, we shall soon clear up all that,\u201d said Bradstreet. \u201cWell, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I could lay my finger on it,\u201d said Holmes quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, now!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cyou have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I say east,\u201d said my patient.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am for west,\u201d remarked the plain-clothes man. \u201cThere are several quiet little villages up there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am for north,\u201d said I, \u201cbecause there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d cried the inspector, laughing; \u201cit\u2019s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are all wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t all be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, you can. This is my point.\u201d He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. \u201cThis is where we shall find them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the twelve-mile drive?\u201d gasped Hatherley.\r\n\r\n\u201cSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\u201d observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. \u201cOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\r\n\r\n\u201cA house on fire?\u201d asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d said the station-master.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did it break out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose house is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Becher\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d broke in the engineer, \u201cis Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \u201cNo, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn\u2019t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \u201cThere is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, at least,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyou have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Holmes\u2019 fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\u2019 ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.\r\n\r\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, \u201cit has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExperience,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cIndirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\u201d\r\n\r\nX.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\r\n\r\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\u2019s noble correspondent could be.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\u201d I remarked as he entered. \u201cYour morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\u201d he answered, smiling, \u201cand the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot social, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, distinctly professional.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd from a noble client?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the highest in England.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks like it,\u201d said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. \u201cI have had nothing else to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, with the deepest interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018ROBERT ST. SIMON.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,\u201d remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says four o\u2019clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\u201d He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. \u201cHere he is,\u201d said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. \u201c\u2018Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.\u2019 Hum! \u2018Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.\u2019 He\u2019s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\u201d said I, \u201cfor the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now\u2014though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: \u2018A marriage has been arranged,\u2019 it says, \u2018and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\u2019 That is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerse and to the point,\u201d remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: \u2018There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god\u2019s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked Holmes, yawning.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later\u2014that is, on Wednesday last\u2014there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater\u2019s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore the what?\u201d asked Holmes with a start.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe vanishing of the lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did she vanish, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the wedding breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn you that they are very incomplete.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps we may make them less so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \u2018Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\u2019:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd is that all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now\u2014so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord Robert St. Simon,\u201d announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,\u201d said Holmes, rising and bowing. \u201cPray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I am descending.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg pardon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy last client of the sort was a king.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe King of Scandinavia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! Had he lost his wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can understand,\u201d said Holmes suavely, \u201cthat I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course! Very right! very right! I\u2019m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\u2014this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \u201cYes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn San Francisco, a year ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were travelling in the States?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you become engaged then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you were on a friendly footing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer father is very rich?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did he make his money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what is your own impression as to the young lady\u2019s\u2014your wife\u2019s character?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. \u201cYou see, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cmy wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous\u2014volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear\u201d\u2014he gave a little stately cough\u2014\u201chad I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you her photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI brought this with me.\u201d He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas she in good spirits?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was as bright as possible\u2014at least until after the ceremony.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd did you observe any change in her then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray let us have it, for all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment\u2019s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman was not one of your wife\u2019s friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father\u2019s house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw her in conversation with her maid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is her maid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA confidential servant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long did she speak to this Alice?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not overhear what they said?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady St. Simon said something about \u2018jumping a claim.\u2019 She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe walked into the breakfast-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn your arm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride\u2019s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\u2019s house that morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWe have been on a friendly footing for some years\u2014I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran\u2019s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid your wife hear all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank goodness, she did not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is a possible supposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\u2014I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success\u2014I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cAnd now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\u201d said our client, rising.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have solved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? What was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say that I have solved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, then, is my wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \u201cI am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,\u201d he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cI think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\u2019s example.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases\u2014but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, then?\u201d asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cYou look dissatisfied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally! You surprise me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,\u201d said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Heaven\u2019s name, what for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy? What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \u201cI suppose you know all about it,\u201d he snarled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it very unlikely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?\u201d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride\u2019s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. \u201cThere,\u201d said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \u201cThere is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \u201cYou dragged them from the Serpentine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\u2019s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you, indeed, now?\u201d cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \u201cI am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.\u201d He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. \u201cListen to this: \u2018You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.\u2019 Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Lestrade,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cYou really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.\u201d He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. \u201cThis is indeed important,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! you find it so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \u201cWhy,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at the wrong side!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, this is the right side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe right side? You\u2019re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201c\u2018Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.\u2019 I see nothing in that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve wasted time enough,\u201d said Lestrade, rising. \u201cI believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.\u201d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,\u201d drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; \u201cI will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. \u201cThere is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,\u201d he remarked, \u201cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was after five o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\u2019s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\r\n\r\nJust before nine o\u2019clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have laid the supper, then,\u201d he said, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\u201d said he. \u201cI am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy messenger reached you, then?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will the Duke say,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwhen he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you look on these things from another standpoint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,\u201d said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I heard a ring,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.\u201d He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. \u201cLord St. Simon,\u201d said he \u201callow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re angry, Robert,\u201d said she. \u201cWell, I guess you have every cause to be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray make no apology to me,\u201d said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\u2019t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn\u2019t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I may give an opinion,\u201d remarked the strange gentleman, \u201cwe\u2019ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\u201d He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell our story right away,\u201d said the lady. \u201cFrank here and I met in \u201984, in McQuire\u2019s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn\u2019t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to \u2019Frisco. Frank wouldn\u2019t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t we be married right away, then,\u2019 said he, \u2018and then I will feel sure of you; and I won\u2019t claim to be your husband until I come back?\u2019 Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners\u2019 camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\u2019s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \u2019Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \u2019Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\u2019d have done my duty by him. We can\u2019t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn\u2019t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn\u2019t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn\u2019t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me\u2014seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also\u2014but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \u2019Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw it in a paper,\u201d explained the American. \u201cIt gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again\u2014just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t forgive me? You won\u2019t shake hands before I go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\u201d He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had hoped,\u201d suggested Holmes, \u201cthat you would have joined us in a friendly supper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that there you ask a little too much,\u201d responded his Lordship. \u201cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\u201d He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe case has been an interesting one,\u201d remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, \u201cbecause it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon\u2019s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\u2019s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\u2014which in miners\u2019 parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to\u2014the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband\u2014the chances being in favour of the latter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how in the world did you find them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you deduce the select?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut with no very good result,\u201d I remarked. \u201cHis conduct was certainly not very gracious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, smiling, \u201cperhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\u201d\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, \u201chere is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe is looking up at the numbers of the houses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that he is coming here,\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\u201d As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\u201d said he. \u201cYou are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt you think me mad?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see that you have had some great trouble,\u201d responded Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod knows I have!\u2014a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray compose yourself, sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cand let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d answered our visitor, \u201cis probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel that time is of value,\u201d said he; \u201cthat is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than\u2014well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth\u2014one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Holder,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The firm does so when the security is good.\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is absolutely essential to me,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I should have \u00a3 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one\u2019s self under obligations.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,\u2019 said I, \u2018were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should much prefer to have it so,\u2019 said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \u2018You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Precisely.\u2019 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. \u2018There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\u2019 said he, \u2018and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You doubt its value?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not at all. I only doubt\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ample.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty \u00a3 1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\u2019 safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\u2014a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\u2019s quick insight into character.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house\u2014sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\u2014forever too late!\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where have you put it?\u2019 asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018In my own bureau.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, I hope to goodness the house won\u2019t be burgled during the night.\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is locked up,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look here, dad,\u2019 said he with his eyes cast down, \u2018can you let me have \u00a3 200?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I cannot!\u2019 I answered sharply. \u2018I have been far too generous with you in money matters.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have been very kind,\u2019 said he, \u2018but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And a very good thing, too!\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\u2019 said he. \u2018I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \u2018You shall not have a farthing from me,\u2019 I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure\u2014a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, dad,\u2019 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \u2018did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite sure, dad.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-night.\u2019 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Arthur!\u2019 I screamed, \u2018you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You blackguard!\u2019 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \u2018You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Stolen!\u2019 he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, thief!\u2019 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have called me names enough,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\u2019 I cried half-mad with grief and rage. \u2018I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You shall learn nothing from me,\u2019 said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. \u2018If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur\u2019s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018At least,\u2019 said he, \u2018you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,\u2019 said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You may as well face the matter,\u2019 said I; \u2018you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\u2019 he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of \u00a3 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you receive much company?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur\u2019s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you go out much in society?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is unusual in a young girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your son\u2019s guilt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was twisted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthur\u2019s closing his bedroom door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave they thought of looking outside the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cis it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what other is there?\u201d cried the banker with a gesture of despair. \u201cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is our task to find that out,\u201d replied Holmes; \u201cso now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker\u2019s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\u2019 judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\r\n\r\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\u2019s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen\u2019s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\u2019s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\u2019s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never let it drop until the gems are found\u2014never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman?\u201d she asked, facing round to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe stable lane?\u201d She raised her dark eyebrows. \u201cWhat can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,\u201d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. \u201cI believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou heard nothing yourself last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere they all fastened this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle\u2019s remarks about the coronet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,\u201d cried the banker impatiently, \u201cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe stood,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cto the left of the door\u2014that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\u2019s expressive black eyes. \u201cWhy, you are like a magician,\u201d said she. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\u2019 thin, eager face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,\u201d said he. \u201cI shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. \u201cNow we shall go upstairs,\u201d said he at last.\r\n\r\nThe banker\u2019s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich key was used to open it?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat which my son himself indicated\u2014that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you it here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is it on the dressing-table.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a noiseless lock,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.\u201d He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\u2019s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Holmes, \u201chere is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \u201cI should not dream of trying,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I will.\u201d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. \u201cI feel it give a little,\u201d said he; \u201cbut, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that I still share my uncle\u2019s perplexity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\u201d said he; \u201cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe banker wrung his hands. \u201cI shall never see them again!\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd my son? You give me hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy opinion is in no way altered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for God\u2019s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would give my fortune to have them back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\u2019s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that this should do,\u201d said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. \u201cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won\u2019t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.\u201d He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\r\n\r\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\u201cI only looked in as I passed,\u201d said he. \u201cI am going right on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don\u2019t wait up for me in case I should be late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\r\n\r\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it is after nine now,\u201d I answered. \u201cI should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\u201d said he. \u201cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDeserted you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MY DEAREST UNCLE,\u2014I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MARY.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would not think \u00a3 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would pay ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for \u00a3 4000.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cI am saved! I am saved!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOwe!\u201d He caught up a pen. \u201cName the sum, and I will pay it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it was not Arthur who took them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Mary? Impossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England\u2014a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!\u201d cried the banker with an ashen face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants\u2019 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible?\u201d gasped the banker.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\u201d cried Mr. Holder. \u201cOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the house,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cI at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen\u2019s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret\u2014the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\u2019s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\u201d said Mr. Holder.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held\u2014\u00a3 1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. \u2018Why, dash it all!\u2019 said he, \u2018I\u2019ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\u2019 I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at \u00a3 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\u2019clock, after what I may call a really hard day\u2019s work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\u201d said the banker, rising. \u201cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that we may safely say,\u201d returned Holmes, \u201cthat she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.\u201d\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the man who loves art for its own sake,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of The Daily Telegraph, \u201cit is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said I, smiling, \u201cI cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have erred, perhaps,\u201d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood\u2014\u201cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\u201d I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\u2019s singular character.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,\u201d said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \u201cIf I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing\u2014a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \u201cyou can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe end may have been so,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\u201d He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.\r\n\r\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR MR. HOLMES,\u2014I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201cVIOLET HUNTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know the young lady?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is half-past ten now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover\u2019s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\u201d said she, as my companion rose to greet her, \u201cbut I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been a governess for five years,\u201d said she, \u201cin the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit\u2019s end as to what I should do.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway\u2019s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That will do,\u2019 said he; \u2018I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!\u2019 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are looking for a situation, miss?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018As governess?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what salary do you ask?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had \u00a3 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, tut, tut! sweating\u2014rank sweating!\u2019 he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \u2018How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\u2019 said I. \u2018A little French, a little German, music, and drawing\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tut, tut!\u2019 he cried. \u2018This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at \u00a3 100 a year.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is also my custom,\u2019 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, \u2018to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018May I ask where you live, sir?\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One child\u2014one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!\u2019 He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was a little startled at the nature of the child\u2019s amusement, but the father\u2019s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My sole duties, then,\u2019 I asked, \u2018are to take charge of a single child?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to make myself useful.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know\u2014faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\u2019 said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that it is quite essential,\u2019 said he. \u2018It is a little fancy of my wife\u2019s, and ladies\u2019 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\u2019 fancies must be consulted. And so you won\u2019t cut your hair?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, sir, I really could not,\u2019 I answered firmly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\u2019 she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If you please, Miss Stoper.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,\u2019 said she sharply. \u2018You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.\u2019 She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting \u00a3 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\r\n\u201c\u2018DEAR MISS HUNTER,\u2014Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give \u00a3 30 a quarter, or \u00a3 120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,\u201d said Holmes, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a possible solution\u2014in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes, of course the pay is good\u2014too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you \u00a3 120 a year, when they could have their pick for \u00a3 40? There must be some strong reason behind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDanger! What danger do you foresee?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \u201cIt would cease to be a danger if we could define it,\u201d said he. \u201cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is enough.\u201d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. \u201cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\u201d With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt least,\u201d said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, \u201cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she would need to be,\u201d said Holmes gravely. \u201cI am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before my friend\u2019s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \u201cData! data! data!\u201d he cried impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t make bricks without clay.\u201d And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\r\n\r\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,\u201d said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\r\n\r\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,\u201d it said. \u201cDo come! I am at my wit\u2019s end.\r\n\r\n\u201cHUNTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d asked Holmes, glancing up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should wish to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look it up, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a train at half-past nine,\u201d said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. \u201cIt is due at Winchester at 11:30.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\u2019s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\u201d I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\r\n\r\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cWho would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\u2019s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. She has her freedom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am so delighted that you have come,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cIt is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray tell us what has happened to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us have everything in its due order.\u201d Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can you not understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton\u2019s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father\u2019s young wife.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad of all details,\u201d remarked my friend, \u201cwhether they seem to you to be relevant or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, turning to me, \u2018we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense r\u00e9pertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Jephro,\u2019 said she, \u2018there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I know no one in these parts.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Surely it would be better to take no notice.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray continue,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour narrative promises to be a most interesting one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look in here!\u2019 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. \u2018Is he not a beauty?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be frightened,\u2019 said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. \u2018It\u2019s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\u2019s as much as your life is worth.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o\u2019clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI assured him that I was not offended. \u2018By the way,\u2019 said I, \u2018you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Photography is one of my hobbies,\u2019 said he. \u2018I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\u2019 He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty\u2014a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\u2019s instinct; perhaps it was woman\u2019s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran\u2014ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018So,\u2019 said he, smiling, \u2018it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I am so frightened!\u2019 I panted.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\u2019\u2014you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was\u2014\u2018and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\u2019 I answered. \u2018But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Only that?\u2019 said he, looking at me keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what did you think?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why do you think that I lock this door?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure that I do not know.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\u2019 He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure if I had known\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again\u2019\u2014here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\u2014\u2018I\u2019ll throw you to the mastiff.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\u2019clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Toller still drunk?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the wine-cellar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will try. What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\u2019clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers\u2014possibly her fianc\u00e9\u2014and no doubt, as you wore the girl\u2019s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\u2019t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child\u2019s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\u2019s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\u201d cried our client. \u201cA thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o\u2019clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you managed it?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \u201cThat is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,\u201d said she. \u201cHer husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done well indeed!\u201d cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \u201cNow lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes\u2019 face clouded over.\r\n\r\n\u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he. \u201cI think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been some villainy here,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthis beauty has guessed Miss Hunter\u2019s intentions and has carried his victim off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\u201d He swung himself up onto the roof. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he cried, \u201chere\u2019s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is impossible,\u201d said Miss Hunter; \u201cthe ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou villain!\u201d said he, \u201cwhere\u2019s your daughter?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is for me to ask you that,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\u2019ll serve you!\u201d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone for the dog!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have my revolver,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter close the front door,\u201d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he cried. \u201cSomeone has loosed the dog. It\u2019s not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle\u2019s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\u2019t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \u201cIt is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will soon make it clear to you,\u201d said she; \u201cand I\u2019d have done so before now if I could ha\u2019 got out from the cellar. If there\u2019s police-court business over this, you\u2019ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\u2019s friend too.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\u2019t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend\u2019s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\u2019s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn\u2019t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\u2019s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\u2019t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said Mrs. Toller serenely.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cfor you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle\u2019s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection.

LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \u201cRight of Replacement or Refund\u201d described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
