I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for drawing the veil from men\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\r\n\r\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\r\n\r\nOne night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\u2014I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\r\n\r\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. \u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it said, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhat do you imagine that it means?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201cSuch paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a \u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d with a small \u201ct\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands for \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019 which is the German for \u2018Company.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like our \u2018Co.\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \u2018Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from all quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of the window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\r\n\r\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said he, \u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor. \u201cThe august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.\r\n\r\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI should be better able to advise you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \u201cYou are right,\u201d he cried; \u201cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can understand,\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \u201cyou can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray consult,\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\u201d murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto\u2014hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\u2014yes! Retired from operatic stage\u2014ha! Living in London\u2014quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. But how\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is the writing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy private note-paper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy own seal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImitated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was mad\u2014insane.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have tried and failed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not sell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sign of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely none.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed. \u201cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a very serious one to me,\u201d returned the King reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo ruin me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am about to be married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Irene Adler?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go\u2014none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, then we have three days yet,\u201d said Holmes with a yawn. \u201cThat is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, as to money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have carte blanche.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd for present expenses?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\u2019s Wood.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes took a note of it. \u201cOne other question,\u201d said he. \u201cWas the photograph a cabinet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\u201d he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \u201cIf you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\u2019clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\u201d\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend\u2019s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really!\u201d he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o\u2019clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\u2019s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am following you closely,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\u2014evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \u2018Drive like the devil,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018first to Gross & Hankey\u2019s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\u2019t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Church of St. Monica, John,\u2019 she cried, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. \u2018The Church of St. Monica,\u2019 said I, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy cabby drove fast. I don\u2019t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he cried. \u2018You\u2019ll do. Come! Come!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What then?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\u2019t be legal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\u201d said I; \u201cand what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \u2018I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\u2019 she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\u201d he answered, ringing the bell. \u201cI have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be delighted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind breaking the law?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in a good cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the cause is excellent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I am your man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was sure that I might rely on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is it you wish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,\u201d he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \u201cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am to be neutral?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when I raise my hand\u2014so\u2014you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is nothing very formidable,\u201d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \u201cIt is an ordinary plumber\u2019s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may entirely rely on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \u201cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, indeed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\u2019s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it has twice been burgled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw! They did not know how to look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how will you look?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will get her to show me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she will refuse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is dead,\u201d cried several voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201d shouted another. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brave fellow,\u201d said a woman. \u201cThey would have had the lady\u2019s purse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\u2019s breathing now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!\u201d\r\n\r\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\r\n\r\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \u201cFire!\u201d The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill\u2014gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids\u2014joined in a general shriek of \u201cFire!\u201d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\u2019s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNothing could have been better. It is all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know where it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe showed me, as I told you she would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not wish to make a mystery,\u201d said he, laughing. \u201cThe matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat also I could fathom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did that help you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when will you call?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that voice before,\u201d said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. \u201cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\u201d\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have really got it!\u201d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have hopes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must have a cab.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my brougham is waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that will simplify matters.\u201d We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cIrene Adler is married,\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried! When?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut to whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she could not love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am in hopes that she does.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why in hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\u2019s plan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true. And yet\u2014! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!\u201d He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Mr. Holmes,\u201d answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. \u201cDo you mean that she has left England?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever to return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the papers?\u201d asked the King hoarsely. \u201cAll is lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see.\u201d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \u201cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\u201d My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\r\n    \u201cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\r\n    \u201cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\n\r\n\u201cVery truly yours,\r\n\u201cIRENE NORTON, n\u00e9e ADLER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a woman\u2014oh, what a woman!\u201d cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. \u201cDid I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\u201d said Holmes coldly. \u201cI am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\u2019s business to a more successful conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\u201d cried the King; \u201cnothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring\u2014\u201d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have but to name it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis photograph!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cIrene\u2019s photograph!\u201d he cried. \u201cCertainly, if you wish it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.\u201d He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\u2019s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\u201d he said cordially.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid that you were engaged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I am. Very much so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I can wait in the next room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry the settee,\u201d said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \u201cI know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\u201d I observed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\r\n\r\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\u2019s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \u201cBeyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It\u2019s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\u2019s carpenter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but China?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\u2019 scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \u201cWell, I never!\u201d said he. \u201cI thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI begin to think, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I make a mistake in explaining. \u2018Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\u2019 you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have got it now,\u201d he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. \u201cHere it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of \u00a3 4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o\u2019clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope\u2019s Court, Fleet Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth does this mean?\u201d I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. \u201cIt is a little off the beaten track, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said he. \u201cAnd now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \u201cI have a small pawnbroker\u2019s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It\u2019s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the name of this obliging youth?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\u2019s not such a youth, either. It\u2019s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ\u00e9 who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don\u2019t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he has his faults, too,\u201d said Mr. Wilson. \u201cNever was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he\u2019s a good worker. There\u2019s no vice in him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is still with you, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean\u2014that\u2019s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why that?\u2019 I asks.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why,\u2019 says he, \u2018here\u2019s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It\u2019s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\u2019 end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\u2019s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what is it, then?\u2019 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\u2019t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\u2019 he asked with his eyes open.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what are they worth?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\u2019s other occupations.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me all about it,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said he, showing me the advertisement, \u2018you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not so many as you might think,\u2019 he answered. \u2018You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\u2019s Court looked like a coster\u2019s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were\u2014straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,\u201d remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \u201cPray continue your very interesting statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\u2019 said my assistant, \u2018and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And he is admirably suited for it,\u2019 the other answered. \u2018He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\u2019 He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It would be injustice to hesitate,\u2019 said he. \u2018You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\u2019 With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. \u2018There is water in your eyes,\u2019 said he as he released me. \u2018I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler\u2019s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\u2019 He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My name,\u2019 said he, \u2018is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI answered that I had not.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis face fell immediately.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me!\u2019 he said gravely, \u2018that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018In the case of another,\u2019 said he, \u2018the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\u2019 said Vincent Spaulding. \u2018I should be able to look after that for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What would be the hours?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ten to two.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cNow a pawnbroker\u2019s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That would suit me very well,\u2019 said I. \u2018And the pay?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is \u00a3 4 a week.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is purely nominal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What do you call purely nominal?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don\u2019t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No excuse will avail,\u2019 said Mr. Duncan Ross; \u2018neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is to copy out the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\u2019 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope\u2019s Court.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o\u2019clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\u2019s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\u2019s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an end?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o\u2019clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:\r\n\r\n\u201cTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot see that there is anything very funny,\u201d cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \u201cIf you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018the gentleman at No. 4.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What, the red-headed man?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where could I find him?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul\u2019s.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you do then?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you did very wisely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGrave enough!\u201d said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \u201cWhy, I have lost four pound a week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as you are personally concerned,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cI do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some \u00a3 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank\u2014if it was a prank\u2014upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement\u2014how long had he been with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout a month then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did he come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn answer to an advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he the only applicant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I had a dozen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you pick him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he was handy and would come cheap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt half wages, in fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\u2019s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \u201cI thought as much,\u201d said he. \u201cHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum!\u201d said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \u201cHe is still with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing to complain of, sir. There\u2019s never very much to do of a morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Watson,\u201d said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \u201cwhat do you make of it all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI make nothing of it,\u201d I answered frankly. \u201cIt is a most mysterious business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a rule,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthe more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo smoke,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won\u2019t speak to me for fifty minutes.\u201d He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\u201cSarasate plays at the St. James\u2019s Hall this afternoon,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with \u201cJABEZ WILSON\u201d in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\u2019s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThird right, fourth left,\u201d answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cSmart fellow, that,\u201d observed Holmes as we walked away. \u201cHe is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvidently,\u201d said I, \u201cMr. Wilson\u2019s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe knees of his trousers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I expected to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you beat the pavement?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy\u2019s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \u201cI should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer\u2019s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\u2019s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we\u2019ve done our work, so it\u2019s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James\u2019s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\u201d he remarked as we emerged.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would be as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy serious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt what time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTen will be early enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be at Baker Street at ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\u201d He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\r\n\r\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclop\u00e6dia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\u2019s assistant was a formidable man\u2014a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! Our party is complete,\u201d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \u201cWatson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\u2019s adventure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\u201d said Jones in his consequential way. \u201cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\u201d observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\u201d said the police agent loftily. \u201cHe has his own little methods, which are, if he won\u2019t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\u201d said the stranger with deference. \u201cStill, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you will find,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cthat you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some \u00a3 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\u2019s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\u2019s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He\u2019ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I\u2019ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\u2019ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are close there now,\u201d my friend remarked. \u201cThis fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\u201d Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor from below,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \u201cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\u201d he remarked, looking up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\u201d said Holmes severely. \u201cYou have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have at least an hour before us,\u201d he remarked, \u201cfor they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor\u2014as no doubt you have divined\u2014in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is our French gold,\u201d whispered the director. \u201cWe have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour French gold?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich were very well justified,\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cAnd now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd sit in the dark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carr\u00e9e, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy\u2019s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\u201d\r\n\r\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness\u2014such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\u2019s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have but one retreat,\u201d whispered Holmes. \u201cThat is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\r\n\r\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\r\n\r\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all clear,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHave you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\u2019ll swing for it!\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\u2019 hunting crop came down on the man\u2019s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use, John Clay,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cYou have no chance at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I see,\u201d the other answered with the utmost coolness. \u201cI fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are three men waiting for him at the door,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I you,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cYour red-headed idea was very new and effective.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see your pal again presently,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\u201d remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \u201cYou may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \u2018sir\u2019 and \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \u201cWell, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is better,\u201d said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \u201cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Watson,\u201d he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \u201cit was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclop\u00e6dia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\u2019s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\u2019s hair. The \u00a3 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\u2019s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\u2019s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar\u2014something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend\u2019s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\u2019s presence\u2014in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou reasoned it out beautifully,\u201d I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. \u201cIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt saved me from ennui,\u201d he answered, yawning. \u201cAlas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are a benefactor of the race,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,\u201d he remarked. \u201c\u2018L\u2019homme c\u2019est rien\u2014l\u2019\u0153uvre c\u2019est tout,\u2019 as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\u201d\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nA CASE OF IDENTITY\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \u201clife is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outr\u00e9 results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,\u201d I answered. \u201cThe cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cThis is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\u201d\r\n\r\nI smiled and shook my head. \u201cI can quite understand your thinking so,\u201d I said. \u201cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here\u201d\u2014I picked up the morning paper from the ground\u2014\u201clet us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \u2018A husband\u2019s cruelty to his wife.\u2019 There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\u201d said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \u201cThis is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the ring?\u201d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd have you any on hand just now?\u201d I asked with interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen those symptoms before,\u201d said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. \u201cOscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de c\u0153ur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not find,\u201d he said, \u201cthat with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did at first,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut now I know where the letters are without looking.\u201d Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,\u201d she cried, \u201celse how could you know all that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Holmes, laughing; \u201cit is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\u2019m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \u201cYes, I did bang out of the house,\u201d she said, \u201cfor it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\u2014that is, my father\u2014took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyour stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your mother is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\u2019t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father\u2019s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got \u00a3 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\u2019t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour own little income,\u201d he asked, \u201cdoes it come out of the business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4\u00bd per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou interest me extremely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAnd since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about \u00a3 60.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don\u2019t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have made your position very clear to me,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\u2019s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. \u201cI met him first at the gasfitters\u2019 ball,\u201d she said. \u201cThey used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\u2019s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Then at the gasfitters\u2019 ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him\u2014that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know father didn\u2019t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\u2019t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer\u2014Mr. Angel\u2014was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat office?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did he live, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe slept on the premises.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know his address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014except that it was Leadenhall Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you address your letters, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\u2019t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was most suggestive,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\u2019d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn\u2019t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\u2019t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt missed him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\u2019s, near King\u2019s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father? Did you tell him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\u2019t sleep a wink at night.\u201d She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall glance into the case for you,\u201d said Holmes, rising, \u201cand I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see him again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what has happened to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI advertised for him in last Saturday\u2019s Chronicle,\u201d said she. \u201cHere is the slip and here are four letters from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. And your address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Angel\u2019s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father\u2019s place of business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,\u201d he observed. \u201cI found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in \u201977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman\u2019s appearance? Describe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn\u2019t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman\u2019s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt surprised me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what else?\u201d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend\u2019s incisive reasoning.\r\n\r\n\u201cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\nI held the little printed slip to the light. \u201cMissing,\u201d it said, \u201con the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,\u201d &c, &c.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAs to the letters,\u201d he continued, glancing over them, \u201cthey are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are typewritten,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little \u2018Hosmer Angel\u2019 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive\u2014in fact, we may call it conclusive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady\u2019s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o\u2019clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\u2019s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\r\n\r\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\r\n\r\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o\u2019clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the d\u00e9nouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, have you solved it?\u201d I asked as I entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, the mystery!\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the girl\u2019s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o\u2019clock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes quietly; \u201cI have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \u201cI am delighted to hear it,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a curious thing,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cthat a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man\u2019s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the \u2018e,\u2019 and a slight defect in the tail of the \u2018r.\u2019 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,\u201d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,\u201d Holmes continued. \u201cI think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the \u2018e\u2019s\u2019 slurred and the \u2018r\u2019s\u2019 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \u201cI cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. \u201cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! where?\u201d shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it won\u2019t do\u2014really it won\u2019t,\u201d said Holmes suavely. \u201cThere is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\u2019s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. \u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s not actionable,\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\u201d said he, \u201cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\u2019s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was only a joke at first,\u201d groaned our visitor. \u201cWe never thought that she would have been so carried away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\u2019s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\u2019s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\u2019s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cbut if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,\u201d said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, \u201cyet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\u201d he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\u2019s face, \u201cit is not part of my duties to my client, but here\u2019s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to\u2014\u201d He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\u201d said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. \u201cThat fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you verify them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise\u2014the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ\u00e9, James Windibank. Voil\u00e0 tout!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Miss Sutherland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, \u2018There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\u2019 There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nTHE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\r\n\r\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you say, dear?\u201d said my wife, looking across at me. \u201cWill you go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 cases.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you heard anything of the case?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat sounds a little paradoxical.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a murder, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\u2014a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\u2019s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of \u2018wilful murder\u2019 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,\u201d I remarked. \u201cIf ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\u201d answered Holmes thoughtfully. \u201cIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said I, \u201cthat the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\u201d he answered, laughing. \u201cBesides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my m\u00e9tier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner\u2019s jury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a confession,\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cit is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cMany men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the young man\u2019s own account of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: \u2018I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \u201cCooee!\u201d which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner\u2019s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I should prefer not to answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I must still refuse.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of \u2018Cooee\u2019 was a common signal between you and your father?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It was.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: Nothing definite.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What do you mean?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, it was gone.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018You cannot say what it was?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I had a feeling something was there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How far from the body?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018A dozen yards or so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And how far from the edge of the wood?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018About the same.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but with my back towards it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis concluded the examination of the witness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said I as I glanced down the column, \u201cthat the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\u2019s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. \u201cBoth you and the coroner have been at some pains,\u201d said he, \u201cto single out the very strongest points in the young man\u2019s favour. Don\u2019t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr\u00e9 as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly four o\u2019clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have ordered a carriage,\u201d said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. \u201cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cIt is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade looked startled. \u201cI do not quite follow,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \u201cYou have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can\u2019t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\u201d she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman\u2019s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, \u201cI am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\u2019t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou may rely upon my doing all that I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that it is very probable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, now!\u201d she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. \u201cYou hear! He gives me hopes.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and\u2014and\u2014well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cWas he in favour of such a union?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.\u201d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for this information,\u201d said he. \u201cMay I see your father if I call to-morrow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid the doctor won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! In Victoria! That is important.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, at the mines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, Miss Turner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\u201d She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\u201d said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes\u2019 silence. \u201cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHave you an order to see him in prison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but only for you and me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmple.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man\u2019s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\u2019s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\u2019 attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\u2019s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\u2019 insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy\u2019s innocence.\r\n\r\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe glass still keeps very high,\u201d he remarked as he sat down. \u201cIt is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you learn from him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould he throw no light?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot admire his taste,\u201d I remarked, \u201cif it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o\u2019clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is serious news this morning,\u201d Lestrade observed. \u201cIt is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn elderly man, I presume?\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\u2019s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! That is interesting,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\u2019s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,\u201d said Lestrade, winking at me. \u201cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Holmes demurely; \u201cyou do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,\u201d replied Lestrade with some warmth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is it.\u201d It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\u2019 request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son\u2019s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\r\n\r\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\u2019s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you go into the pool for?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.\u201d He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. \u201cThese are young McCarthy\u2019s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father\u2019s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again\u2014of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\u201d He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been a case of considerable interest,\u201d he remarked, returning to his natural manner. \u201cI fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis may interest you, Lestrade,\u201d he remarked, holding it out. \u201cThe murder was done with it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see no marks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the murderer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed. \u201cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\u201d he said. \u201cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNous verrons,\u201d answered Holmes calmly. \u201cYou work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd leave your case unfinished?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the mystery?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is solved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was the criminal, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gentleman I describe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am a practical man,\u201d he said, \u201cand I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cI have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Watson,\u201d he said when the cloth was cleared \u201cjust sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\u2019t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy\u2019s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\u2019s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of this \u2018Cooee!\u2019 then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The \u2018Cooee!\u2019 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But \u2018Cooee\u2019 is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of the rat, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. \u201cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\u201d he said. \u201cI wired to Bristol for it last night.\u201d He put his hand over part of the map. \u201cWhat do you read?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cARAT,\u201d I read.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d He raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cBALLARAT.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son\u2019s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how did you gain them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they were peculiar boots.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his lameness?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\u2014he was lame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his left-handedness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the cigar-holder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. John Turner,\u201d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray sit down on the sofa,\u201d said Holmes gently. \u201cYou had my note?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why did you wish to see me?\u201d He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \u201cIt is so. I know all about McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \u201cGod help me!\u201d he cried. \u201cBut I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad to hear you say so,\u201d said Holmes gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart\u2014it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may not come to that,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a dying man,\u201d said old Turner. \u201cI have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. \u201cJust tell us the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as well,\u201d said the old man; \u201cit\u2019s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I\u2019ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in the early \u201960\u2019s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Here we are, Jack,\u2019 says he, touching me on the arm; \u2018we\u2019ll be as good as a family to you. There\u2019s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there\u2019s always a policeman within hail.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is not for me to judge you,\u201d said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. \u201cI pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFarewell, then,\u201d said the old man solemnly. \u201cYour own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.\u201d Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod help us!\u201d said Holmes after a long silence. \u201cWhy does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter\u2019s words, and say, \u2018There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\r\n\r\nV.\r\nTHE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\r\n\r\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years \u201982 and \u201990, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.\r\n\r\nThe year \u201987 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\u2019s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\u2014a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell\u2019s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\u2019s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said I, glancing up at my companion, \u201cthat was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept yourself I have none,\u201d he answered. \u201cI do not encourage visitors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA client, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. \u201cI trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me your coat and umbrella,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, from Horsham.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come for advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is easily got.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not always so easy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said that you could solve anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said too much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you are never beaten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been beaten four times\u2014three times by men, and once by a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true that I have been generally successful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may be so with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no ordinary one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou fill me with interest,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d said he, \u201cis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know that my grandfather had two sons\u2014my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\u2019s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\u2019s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day\u2014it was in March, 1883\u2014a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\u2019s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \u2018From India!\u2019 said he as he took it up, \u2018Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\u2019 Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, \u2018K. K. K.!\u2019 he shrieked, and then, \u2018My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What is it, uncle?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Death,\u2019 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018They may do what they like, but I\u2019ll checkmate them still,\u2019 said he with an oath. \u2018Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish you, John,\u2019 said my uncle, \u2018to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\u2019t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \u2018suicide.\u2019 But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some \u00a3 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Holmes interposed, \u201cyour statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. Pray proceed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and \u2018Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\u2019 written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\u2019s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was the beginning of \u201984 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of \u201985. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\u2019 he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy heart had turned to lead. \u2018It is K. K. K.,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked inside the envelope. \u2018So it is,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Put the papers on the sundial,\u2019 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What papers? What sundial?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\u2019 said I; \u2018but the papers must be those that are destroyed.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Pooh!\u2019 said he, gripping hard at his courage. \u2018We are in a civilised land here, and we can\u2019t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018From Dundee,\u2019 I answered, glancing at the postmark.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Some preposterous practical joke,\u2019 said he. \u2018What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should certainly speak to the police,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then let me do so?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I forbid you. I won\u2019t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \u2018death from accidental causes.\u2019 Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\u2019s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in January, \u201985, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the envelope,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe postmark is London\u2014eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father\u2019s last message: \u2018K. K. K.\u2019; and then \u2018Put the papers on the sundial.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell the truth\u201d\u2014he sank his face into his thin, white hands\u2014\u201cI have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut! tut!\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \u201cIncredible imbecility!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he come with you to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. His orders were to stay in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d he said, \u201cand, above all, why did you not come at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us\u2014no suggestive detail which might help us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one thing,\u201d said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \u201cI have some remembrance,\u201d said he, \u201cthat on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, \u201cMarch, 1869,\u201d and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\r\n\r\n\u201c4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\r\n\r\n\u201c7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\u201c9th. McCauley cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201c10th. John Swain cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201c12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. \u201cAnd now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. \u201cYou have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy train from Waterloo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am armed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall see you at Horsham, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\u201d He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements\u2014blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\u2014and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, Watson,\u201d he remarked at last, \u201cthat of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut have you,\u201d I asked, \u201cformed any definite conception as to what these perils are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere can be no question as to their nature,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \u201cThe ideal reasoner,\u201d he remarked, \u201cwould, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclop\u00e6dias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, laughing. \u201cIt was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclop\u00e6dia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom East London. What do you deduce from that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability\u2014the strong probability\u2014is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA greater distance to travel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I do not see the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\u2019s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut of what society?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you never\u2014\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice\u2014\u201chave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never have.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \u201cHere it is,\u201d said he presently:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape\u2014a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will observe,\u201d said Holmes, laying down the volume, \u201cthat the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the page we have seen\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \u2018sent the pips to A, B, and C\u2019\u2014that is, sent the society\u2019s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me for not waiting for you,\u201d said he; \u201cI have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat steps will you take?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not go there first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou are too late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said he, laying down his cup, \u201cI feared as much. How was it done?\u201d He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \u2018Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\u2019 Here is the account:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\u2014!\u201d He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must be cunning devils,\u201d he exclaimed at last. \u201cHow could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\u2019clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are hungry,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how have you succeeded?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a clue?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \u201cS. H. for J. O.\u201d Then he sealed it and addressed it to \u201cCaptain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will await him when he enters port,\u201d said he, chuckling. \u201cIt may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is this Captain Calhoun?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you trace it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have spent the whole day,\u201d said he, \u201cover Lloyd\u2019s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \u201983. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTexas, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, \u201985, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you do, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \u201cL. S.\u201d carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nTHE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\r\n\r\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George\u2019s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey\u2019s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\r\n\r\nOne night\u2014it was in June, \u201989\u2014there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201cA patient!\u201d said she. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go out.\u201d\r\n\r\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\r\n\r\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my calling so late,\u201d she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife\u2019s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \u201cOh, I\u2019m in such trouble!\u201d she cried; \u201cI do so want a little help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said my wife, pulling up her veil, \u201cit is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\u201d That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, no! I want the doctor\u2019s advice and help, too. It\u2019s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\u2019s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\r\n\r\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\r\n\r\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\u2019s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.\r\n\r\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\r\n\r\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I have not come to stay,\u201d said I. \u201cThere is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! It\u2019s Watson,\u201d said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \u201cI say, Watson, what o\u2019clock is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNearly eleven.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf Friday, June 19th.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\u2019you want to frighten a chap for?\u201d He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I am. But you\u2019ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes\u2014I forget how many. But I\u2019ll go home with you. I wouldn\u2019t frighten Kate\u2014poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have one waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, \u201cWalk past me, and then look back at me.\u201d The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes!\u201d I whispered, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing in this den?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs low as you can,\u201d he answered; \u201cI have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a cab outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\u2019s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was certainly surprised to find you there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not more so than I to find you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to find a friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I to find an enemy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn enemy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour\u2019s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul\u2019s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! You do not mean bodies?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had \u00a3 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\u201d He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\u2014a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\u2019 hoofs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I can be of use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Cedars?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; that is Mr. St. Clair\u2019s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNear Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am all in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you are. You\u2019ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here\u2019s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt makes you quite invaluable as a companion. \u2019Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget that I know nothing about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There\u2019s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\u2019t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I\u2019ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProceed, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome years ago\u2014to be definite, in May, 1884\u2014there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to \u00a3 88 10s., while he has \u00a3 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\u2019s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\r\n\r\n\u201cConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps\u2014for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night\u2014and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children\u2019s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\u2014all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\u2019s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a cripple!\u201d said I. \u201cWhat could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray continue your narrative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\u2019s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies\u2014421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat\u2019s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt certainly sounds feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\u2014what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance\u2014are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are on the outskirts of Lee,\u201d said my companion. \u201cWe have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse\u2019s feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\u2019s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d she cried, \u201cwell?\u201d And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo good news?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo bad?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am delighted to see you,\u201d said she, pressing my hand warmly. \u201cYou will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear madam,\u201d said I, \u201cI am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, \u201cI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon what point?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \u201cFrankly, now!\u201d she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrankly, then, madam, I do not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think that he is dead?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMurdered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t say that. Perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on what day did he meet his death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he roared.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, to-day.\u201d She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoarse writing,\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cSurely this is not your husband\u2019s writing, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but the enclosure is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can you tell that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are sure that this is your husband\u2019s hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.\u2014NEVILLE.\u2019 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband\u2019s hand, madam?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone. Neville wrote those words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, much may have happened between.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the window open?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he might have called to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA call for help, you thought?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He waved his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you thought he was pulled back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe disappeared so suddenly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\r\n\r\n\u201cAwake, Watson?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGame for a morning drive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\u201d He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\r\n\r\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to test a little theory of mine,\u201d said he, pulling on his boots. \u201cI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd where is it?\u201d I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d he answered. \u201cOh, yes, I am not joking,\u201d he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. \u201cI have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been in some points a singular case,\u201d said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. \u201cI confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse\u2019s head while the other led us in.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is on duty?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\u201d A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \u201cI wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI called about that beggarman, Boone\u2014the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I heard. You have him here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the cells.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he quiet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDirty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker\u2019s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to see him very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I think that I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Come this way, if you please.\u201d He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe third on the right is his,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHere it is!\u201d He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is asleep,\u201d said he. \u201cYou can see him very well.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe certainly needs a wash,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cI had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\u201d He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe! he! You are a funny one,\u201d chuckled the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why not,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\u201d He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d he shouted, \u201cto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.\u201d\r\n\r\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\u2019s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat heavens!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cit is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. \u201cBe it so,\u201d said he. \u201cAnd pray what am I charged with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith making away with Mr. Neville St.\u2014 Oh, come, you can\u2019t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\u201d said the inspector with a grin. \u201cWell, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not the wife; it was the children,\u201d groaned the prisoner. \u201cGod help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\u201d said he, \u201cof course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you!\u201d cried the prisoner passionately. \u201cI would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for \u00a3 25. I was at my wit\u2019s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight\u2019s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at \u00a3 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn \u00a3 700 a year\u2014which is less than my average takings\u2014but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take \u00a3 2.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife\u2019s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat note only reached her yesterday,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God! What a week she must have spent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe police have watched this Lascar,\u201d said Inspector Bradstreet, \u201cand I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \u201cI have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMany times; but what was a fine to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must stop here, however,\u201d said Bradstreet. \u201cIf the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reached this one,\u201d said my friend, \u201cby sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are engaged,\u201d said I; \u201cperhaps I interrupt you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\u201d\u2014he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat\u2014\u201cbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\u201d\r\n\r\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. \u201cI suppose,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\u2014that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no. No crime,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cOnly one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much so,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is to him that this trophy belongs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is his hat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\u2019s fire. The facts are these: about four o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\u2019s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich surely he restored to their owner?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \u2018For Mrs. Henry Baker\u2019 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\u2019s left leg, and it is also true that the initials \u2018H. B.\u2019 are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, then, did Peterson do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he not advertise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly as much as we can deduce.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom his hat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker\u2019s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \u201cH. B.\u201d were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can see nothing,\u201d said I, handing it back to my friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. \u201cIt is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,\u201d he remarked, \u201cand yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\u201d he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. \u201cHe is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt is a question of cubic capacity,\u201d said he; \u201ca man with so large a brain must have something in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe decline of his fortunes, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \u201cHere is the foresight,\u201d said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. \u201cThey are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his wife\u2014you said that she had ceased to love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week\u2019s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\u2019s affection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he might be a bachelor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird\u2019s leg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow\u2014walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is very ingenious,\u201d said I, laughing; \u201cbut since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?\u201d Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man\u2019s excited face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\u201d He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \u201cBy Jove, Peterson!\u201d said he, \u201cthis is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the Countess of Morcar\u2019s blue carbuncle!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of \u00a3 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\u201d The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\u2019s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.\u201d He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\u201cHotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\u2019s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! So much for the police-court,\u201d said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. \u201cThe question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \u2018Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.\u2019 That is clear and concise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery. But will he see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn which, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James\u2019s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, sir. And this stone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. \u201cIt\u2019s a bonny thing,\u201d said he. \u201cJust see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil\u2019s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I\u2019ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you can do nothing until then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes\u2019 room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Henry Baker, I believe,\u201d said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. \u201cPray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes\u2019 surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have retained these things for some days,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cbecause we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \u201cShillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo eat it!\u201d Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, certainly,\u201d answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cThey might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,\u201d said he, \u201cbut beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,\u201d said he. \u201cBy the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. \u201cThere are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum\u2014we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\u201d With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for Mr. Henry Baker,\u201d said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. \u201cIt is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors\u2019 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy geese!\u201d The man seemed surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\u2019s not our geese.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! Whose, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBreckinridge is his name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I don\u2019t know him. Well, here\u2019s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow for Mr. Breckinridge,\u201d he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. \u201cRemember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years\u2019 penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening. It\u2019s a cold night,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cSold out of geese, I see,\u201d continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but I was recommended to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho by?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe landlord of the Alpha.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, mister,\u201d said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, \u201cwhat are you driving at? Let\u2019s have it straight, now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then, I shan\u2019t tell you. So now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\u2019t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWarm! You\u2019d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it\u2019s \u2018Where are the geese?\u2019 and \u2018Who did you sell the geese to?\u2019 and \u2018What will you take for the geese?\u2019 One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,\u201d said Holmes carelessly. \u201cIf you won\u2019t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I\u2019m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, you\u2019ve lost your fiver, for it\u2019s town bred,\u201d snapped the salesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never persuade me to believe that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you bet, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\u2019ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \u201cBring me the books, Bill,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, Mr. Cocksure,\u201d said the salesman, \u201cI thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you\u2019ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\u2019you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\u2014249,\u201d read Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \u201cHere you are, \u2018Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, what\u2019s the last entry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. There you are. And underneath?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you to say now?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \u2018Pink \u2019un\u2019 protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\u201d said he. \u201cI daresay that if I had put \u00a3 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you and your geese,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I\u2019ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I\u2019ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; but one of them was mine all the same,\u201d whined the little man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe told me to ask you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\u2019ve had enough of it. Get out of this!\u201d He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\u201d whispered Holmes. \u201cCome with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\u201d Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you, then? What do you want?\u201d he asked in a quavering voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me,\u201d said Holmes blandly, \u201cbut I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can know nothing of this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\u201d cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \u201cI can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \u201cIn that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,\u201d said he. \u201cBut pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \u201cMy name is John Robinson,\u201d he answered with a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; the real name,\u201d said Holmes sweetly. \u201cIt is always awkward doing business with an alias.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \u201cWell then,\u201d said he, \u201cmy real name is James Ryder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. \u201cThe fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested\u2014white, with a black bar across the tail.\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder quivered with emotion. \u201cOh, sir,\u201d he cried, \u201ccan you tell me where it went to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt came here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\u2019t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead\u2014the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe game\u2019s up, Ryder,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cHold up, man, or you\u2019ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\u2019s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\u201d said he in a crackling voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see\u2014her ladyship\u2019s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady\u2019s room\u2014you and your confederate Cusack\u2014and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion\u2019s knees. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cThink of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\u2019ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don\u2019t bring it into court! For Christ\u2019s sake, don\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet back into your chair!\u201d said Holmes sternly. \u201cIt is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \u201cI will tell you it just as it happened, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister\u2019s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds\u2014a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\u2019 says she.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018you said you\u2019d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 says she, \u2018we\u2019ve set yours aside for you\u2014Jem\u2019s bird, we call it. It\u2019s the big white one over yonder. There\u2019s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thank you, Maggie,\u2019 says I; \u2018but if it is all the same to you, I\u2019d rather have that one I was handling just now.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The other is a good three pound heavier,\u2019 said she, \u2018and we fattened it expressly for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never mind. I\u2019ll have the other, and I\u2019ll take it now,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, just as you like,\u2019 said she, a little huffed. \u2018Which is it you want, then?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\u2019s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where are they all, Maggie?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Gone to the dealer\u2019s, Jem.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Which dealer\u2019s?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But was there another with a barred tail?\u2019 I asked, \u2018the same as the one I chose?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now\u2014and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!\u201d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more words. Get out!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, \u201cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.\u201d\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\r\n\r\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was early in April in the year \u201983 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut it\u2019s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then\u2014a fire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-morning, madam,\u201d said Holmes cheerily. \u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not cold which makes me shiver,\u201d said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\u201d She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not fear,\u201d said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. \u201cWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know me, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no mystery, my dear madam,\u201d said he, smiling. \u201cThe left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\u201d said she. \u201cI started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to\u2014none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\r\n\r\n\u201cFarintosh,\u201d said he. \u201cAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas!\u201d replied our visitor, \u201cthe very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am all attention, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes nodded his head. \u201cThe name is familiar to me,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother\u2019s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money\u2014not less than \u00a3 1000 a year\u2014and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died\u2014she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather\u2019s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister is dead, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\u2019s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady\u2019s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray be precise as to details,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\u2019s, the second my sister\u2019s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\u2019clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, Helen,\u2019 said she, \u2018have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not. But why?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from\u2014perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\u2019 She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister\u2019s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister\u2019s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, \u2018Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\u2019 There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor\u2019s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister\u2019s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d said Holmes, \u201care you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas your sister dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\u2019s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about poison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there are nearly always some there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\u2014a speckled band?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are very deep waters,\u201d said he; \u201cpray go on with your narrative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage\u2014Percy Armitage\u2014the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done wisely,\u201d said my friend. \u201cBut have you told me all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor\u2019s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been cruelly used,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \u201cHe is a hard man,\u201d she said, \u201cand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very deep business,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThere are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o\u2019clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.\u201d She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDark enough and sinister enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter\u2019s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what, then, did the gipsies do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see many objections to any such theory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich of you is Holmes?\u201d asked this apparition.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\u201d said my companion quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, Doctor,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cPray take a seat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a little cold for the time of the year,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has she been saying to you?\u201d screamed the old man furiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\u201d continued my companion imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! You put me off, do you?\u201d said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. \u201cI know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes, the busybody!\u201d\r\n\r\nHis smile broadened.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \u201cYour conversation is most entertaining,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will go when I have had my say. Don\u2019t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\u201d He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,\u201d he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems a very amiable person,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cI am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\u201d As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\r\n\r\n\u201cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\u2019 Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,\u201d said he. \u201cTo determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife\u2019s death was little short of \u00a3 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than \u00a3 750. Each daughter can claim an income of \u00a3 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning\u2019s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley\u2019s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook there!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\r\n\r\n\u201cStoke Moran?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\u201d remarked the driver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is some building going on there,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthat is where we are going.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the village,\u201d said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; \u201cbut if you want to get to the house, you\u2019ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\u201d observed Holmes, shading his eyes. \u201cYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought it as well,\u201d said Holmes as we climbed the stile, \u201cthat this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. \u201cI have been waiting so eagerly for you,\u201d she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \u201cAll has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have had the pleasure of making the Doctor\u2019s acquaintance,\u201d said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d she cried, \u201che has followed me, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it appears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\u2019s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister\u2019s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott\u2019s chamber?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \u201cHum!\u201d said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \u201cmy theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere does that bell communicate with?\u201d he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt goes to the housekeeper\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks newer than the other things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.\u201d He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a dummy,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t it ring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery strange!\u201d muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \u201cThere are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is also quite modern,\u201d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey seem to have been of a most interesting character\u2014dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d he asked, tapping the safe.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy stepfather\u2019s business papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you have seen inside, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a cat in it, for example?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. What a strange idea!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, look at this!\u201d He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; we don\u2019t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\u201d He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. That is quite settled,\u201d said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. \u201cHullo! Here is something interesting!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common enough lash. But I don\u2019t know why it should be tied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\u2019s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had never seen my friend\u2019s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall most certainly do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI assure you that I am in your hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is the Crown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Your windows would be visible from there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, easily.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe rest you will leave in our hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what will you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\u201d said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\u2019s sleeve.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for pity\u2019s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\u2019s death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor\u2019s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, \u201cI have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I be of assistance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour presence might be invaluable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall certainly come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very kind of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw the ventilator, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott\u2019s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\u2019s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what harm can there be in that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot as yet see any connection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope\u2014or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness\u2019 sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\u2019clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is our signal,\u201d said Holmes, springing to his feet; \u201cit comes from the middle window.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\r\n\r\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d I whispered; \u201cdid you see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a nice household,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat is the baboon.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes\u2019 example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\r\n\r\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\r\n\r\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible\u2014a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see it, Watson?\u201d he yelled. \u201cYou see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can it mean?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt means that it is all over,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cAnd perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe band! the speckled band!\u201d whispered Holmes.\r\n\r\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a swamp adder!\u201d cried Holmes; \u201cthe deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\u2019s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile\u2019s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm\u2019s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\r\n\r\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had,\u201d said he, \u201ccome to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word \u2018band,\u2019 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.\u201d\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\u2019S THUMB\r\n\r\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice\u2014that of Mr. Hatherley\u2019s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\u2019s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of \u201989, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\u2019clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got him here,\u201d he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; \u201che\u2019s all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new patient,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI thought I\u2019d bring him round myself; then he couldn\u2019t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\u201d And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\r\n\r\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took it up and glanced at it. \u201cMr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\u201d That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. \u201cI regret that I have kept you waiting,\u201d said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \u201cYou are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my night could not be called monotonous,\u201d said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d I cried; \u201cpull yourself together!\u201d and I poured out some water from a caraffe.\r\n\r\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been making a fool of myself,\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Drink this.\u201d I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried, \u201cthis is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! You should have been a surgeon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis has been done,\u201d said I, examining the wound, \u201cby a very heavy and sharp instrument.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA thing like a cleaver,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn accident, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! a murderous attack?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery murderous indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is that?\u201d I asked when I had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cCapital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d cried I, \u201cif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have heard of that fellow,\u201d answered my visitor, \u201cand I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do better. I\u2019ll take you round to him myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be immensely obliged to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.\u201d I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley,\u201d said he. \u201cPray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said my patient, \u201cbut I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\u2019s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to \u00a3 27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of \u2018Colonel Lysander Stark\u2019 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Hatherley?\u2019 said he, with something of a German accent. \u2018You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. \u2018May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That is quite correct,\u2019 I answered; \u2018but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential\u2014absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If I promise to keep a secret,\u2019 said I, \u2018you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you promise, then?\u2019 said he at last.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, I promise.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have already given you my word.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 said he, coming back. \u2018I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master\u2019s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.\u2019 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\r\n\r\n\u201cA feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I beg that you will state your business, sir,\u2019 said I; \u2018my time is of value.\u2019 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How would fifty guineas for a night\u2019s work suit you?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Most admirably.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I say a night\u2019s work, but an hour\u2019s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where to?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There is a drive, then?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said I, \u2018I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Entirely.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller\u2019s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have heard so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Some little time ago I bought a small place\u2014a very small place\u2014within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller\u2019s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left\u2014both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I quite follow you,\u2019 said I. \u2018The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller\u2019s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he carelessly, \u2018we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\u2019 He rose as he spoke. \u2018I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I shall certainly be there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And not a word to a soul.\u2019 He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller\u2019s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o\u2019clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne horse?\u201d interjected Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, only one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you observe the colour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTired-looking or fresh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, fresh and glossy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,\u2019 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. \u2018I shall not keep you waiting an instant,\u2019 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I would go,\u2019 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; \u2018I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But, madam,\u2019 said I, \u2018I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is not worth your while to wait,\u2019 she went on. \u2018You can pass through the door; no one hinders.\u2019 And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. \u2018For the love of Heaven!\u2019 she whispered, \u2018get away from here before it is too late!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is my secretary and manager,\u2019 said the colonel. \u2018By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018On the contrary,\u2019 said I, \u2018I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \u2018Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,\u2019 said he. \u2018Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no, it is in the house.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What, you dig fuller\u2019s-earth in the house?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWe went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\r\n\r\n\u201cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We are now,\u2019 said he, \u2018actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\u2019s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What are you doing there?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. \u2018I was admiring your fuller\u2019s-earth,\u2019 said I; \u2018I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018you shall know all about the machine.\u2019 He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 I yelled. \u2018Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come! come!\u2019 she cried breathlessly. \u2018They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit\u2019s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is your only chance,\u2019 said she. \u2018It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\u2019s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Fritz! Fritz!\u2019 she cried in English, \u2018remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are mad, Elise!\u2019 he shouted, struggling to break away from her. \u2018You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\u2019 He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\u2019s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is an advertisement which will interest you,\u201d said he. \u201cIt appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \u2018Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\u2019clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,\u2019 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried my patient. \u201cThen that explains what the girl said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said he. \u201cThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was an hour\u2019s good drive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I cannot understand,\u201d said I, \u201cis why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman\u2019s entreaties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, we shall soon clear up all that,\u201d said Bradstreet. \u201cWell, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I could lay my finger on it,\u201d said Holmes quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, now!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cyou have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I say east,\u201d said my patient.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am for west,\u201d remarked the plain-clothes man. \u201cThere are several quiet little villages up there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am for north,\u201d said I, \u201cbecause there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d cried the inspector, laughing; \u201cit\u2019s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are all wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t all be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, you can. This is my point.\u201d He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. \u201cThis is where we shall find them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the twelve-mile drive?\u201d gasped Hatherley.\r\n\r\n\u201cSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\u201d observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. \u201cOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\r\n\r\n\u201cA house on fire?\u201d asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d said the station-master.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did it break out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose house is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Becher\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d broke in the engineer, \u201cis Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \u201cNo, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn\u2019t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \u201cThere is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, at least,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyou have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Holmes\u2019 fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\u2019 ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.\r\n\r\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, \u201cit has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExperience,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cIndirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\u201d\r\n\r\nX.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\r\n\r\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\u2019s noble correspondent could be.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\u201d I remarked as he entered. \u201cYour morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\u201d he answered, smiling, \u201cand the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot social, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, distinctly professional.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd from a noble client?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the highest in England.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks like it,\u201d said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. \u201cI have had nothing else to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, with the deepest interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018ROBERT ST. SIMON.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,\u201d remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says four o\u2019clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\u201d He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. \u201cHere he is,\u201d said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. \u201c\u2018Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.\u2019 Hum! \u2018Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.\u2019 He\u2019s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\u201d said I, \u201cfor the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now\u2014though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: \u2018A marriage has been arranged,\u2019 it says, \u2018and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\u2019 That is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerse and to the point,\u201d remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: \u2018There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god\u2019s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked Holmes, yawning.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later\u2014that is, on Wednesday last\u2014there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater\u2019s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore the what?\u201d asked Holmes with a start.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe vanishing of the lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did she vanish, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the wedding breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn you that they are very incomplete.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps we may make them less so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \u2018Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\u2019:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd is that all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now\u2014so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord Robert St. Simon,\u201d announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,\u201d said Holmes, rising and bowing. \u201cPray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I am descending.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg pardon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy last client of the sort was a king.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe King of Scandinavia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! Had he lost his wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can understand,\u201d said Holmes suavely, \u201cthat I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course! Very right! very right! I\u2019m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\u2014this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \u201cYes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn San Francisco, a year ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were travelling in the States?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you become engaged then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you were on a friendly footing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer father is very rich?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did he make his money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what is your own impression as to the young lady\u2019s\u2014your wife\u2019s character?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. \u201cYou see, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cmy wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous\u2014volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear\u201d\u2014he gave a little stately cough\u2014\u201chad I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you her photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI brought this with me.\u201d He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas she in good spirits?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was as bright as possible\u2014at least until after the ceremony.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd did you observe any change in her then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray let us have it, for all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment\u2019s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman was not one of your wife\u2019s friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father\u2019s house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw her in conversation with her maid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is her maid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA confidential servant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long did she speak to this Alice?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not overhear what they said?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady St. Simon said something about \u2018jumping a claim.\u2019 She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe walked into the breakfast-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn your arm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride\u2019s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\u2019s house that morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWe have been on a friendly footing for some years\u2014I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran\u2019s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid your wife hear all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank goodness, she did not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is a possible supposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\u2014I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success\u2014I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cAnd now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\u201d said our client, rising.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have solved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? What was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say that I have solved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, then, is my wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \u201cI am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,\u201d he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cI think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\u2019s example.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases\u2014but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, then?\u201d asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cYou look dissatisfied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally! You surprise me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,\u201d said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Heaven\u2019s name, what for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy? What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \u201cI suppose you know all about it,\u201d he snarled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it very unlikely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?\u201d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride\u2019s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. \u201cThere,\u201d said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \u201cThere is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \u201cYou dragged them from the Serpentine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\u2019s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you, indeed, now?\u201d cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \u201cI am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.\u201d He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. \u201cListen to this: \u2018You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.\u2019 Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Lestrade,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cYou really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.\u201d He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. \u201cThis is indeed important,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! you find it so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \u201cWhy,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at the wrong side!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, this is the right side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe right side? You\u2019re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201c\u2018Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.\u2019 I see nothing in that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve wasted time enough,\u201d said Lestrade, rising. \u201cI believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.\u201d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,\u201d drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; \u201cI will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. \u201cThere is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,\u201d he remarked, \u201cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was after five o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\u2019s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\r\n\r\nJust before nine o\u2019clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have laid the supper, then,\u201d he said, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\u201d said he. \u201cI am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy messenger reached you, then?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will the Duke say,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwhen he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you look on these things from another standpoint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,\u201d said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I heard a ring,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.\u201d He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. \u201cLord St. Simon,\u201d said he \u201callow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re angry, Robert,\u201d said she. \u201cWell, I guess you have every cause to be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray make no apology to me,\u201d said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\u2019t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn\u2019t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I may give an opinion,\u201d remarked the strange gentleman, \u201cwe\u2019ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\u201d He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell our story right away,\u201d said the lady. \u201cFrank here and I met in \u201984, in McQuire\u2019s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn\u2019t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to \u2019Frisco. Frank wouldn\u2019t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t we be married right away, then,\u2019 said he, \u2018and then I will feel sure of you; and I won\u2019t claim to be your husband until I come back?\u2019 Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners\u2019 camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\u2019s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \u2019Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \u2019Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\u2019d have done my duty by him. We can\u2019t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn\u2019t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn\u2019t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn\u2019t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me\u2014seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also\u2014but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \u2019Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw it in a paper,\u201d explained the American. \u201cIt gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again\u2014just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t forgive me? You won\u2019t shake hands before I go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\u201d He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had hoped,\u201d suggested Holmes, \u201cthat you would have joined us in a friendly supper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that there you ask a little too much,\u201d responded his Lordship. \u201cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\u201d He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe case has been an interesting one,\u201d remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, \u201cbecause it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon\u2019s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\u2019s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\u2014which in miners\u2019 parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to\u2014the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband\u2014the chances being in favour of the latter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how in the world did you find them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you deduce the select?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut with no very good result,\u201d I remarked. \u201cHis conduct was certainly not very gracious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, smiling, \u201cperhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\u201d\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, \u201chere is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe is looking up at the numbers of the houses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that he is coming here,\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\u201d As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\u201d said he. \u201cYou are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt you think me mad?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see that you have had some great trouble,\u201d responded Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod knows I have!\u2014a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray compose yourself, sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cand let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d answered our visitor, \u201cis probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel that time is of value,\u201d said he; \u201cthat is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than\u2014well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth\u2014one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Holder,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The firm does so when the security is good.\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is absolutely essential to me,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I should have \u00a3 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one\u2019s self under obligations.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,\u2019 said I, \u2018were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should much prefer to have it so,\u2019 said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \u2018You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Precisely.\u2019 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. \u2018There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\u2019 said he, \u2018and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You doubt its value?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not at all. I only doubt\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ample.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty \u00a3 1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\u2019 safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\u2014a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\u2019s quick insight into character.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house\u2014sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\u2014forever too late!\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where have you put it?\u2019 asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018In my own bureau.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, I hope to goodness the house won\u2019t be burgled during the night.\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is locked up,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look here, dad,\u2019 said he with his eyes cast down, \u2018can you let me have \u00a3 200?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I cannot!\u2019 I answered sharply. \u2018I have been far too generous with you in money matters.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have been very kind,\u2019 said he, \u2018but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And a very good thing, too!\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\u2019 said he. \u2018I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \u2018You shall not have a farthing from me,\u2019 I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure\u2014a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, dad,\u2019 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \u2018did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite sure, dad.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-night.\u2019 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Arthur!\u2019 I screamed, \u2018you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You blackguard!\u2019 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \u2018You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Stolen!\u2019 he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, thief!\u2019 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have called me names enough,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\u2019 I cried half-mad with grief and rage. \u2018I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You shall learn nothing from me,\u2019 said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. \u2018If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur\u2019s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018At least,\u2019 said he, \u2018you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,\u2019 said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You may as well face the matter,\u2019 said I; \u2018you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\u2019 he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of \u00a3 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you receive much company?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur\u2019s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you go out much in society?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is unusual in a young girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your son\u2019s guilt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was twisted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthur\u2019s closing his bedroom door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave they thought of looking outside the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cis it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what other is there?\u201d cried the banker with a gesture of despair. \u201cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is our task to find that out,\u201d replied Holmes; \u201cso now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker\u2019s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\u2019 judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\r\n\r\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\u2019s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen\u2019s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\u2019s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\u2019s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never let it drop until the gems are found\u2014never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman?\u201d she asked, facing round to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe stable lane?\u201d She raised her dark eyebrows. \u201cWhat can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,\u201d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. \u201cI believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou heard nothing yourself last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere they all fastened this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle\u2019s remarks about the coronet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,\u201d cried the banker impatiently, \u201cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe stood,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cto the left of the door\u2014that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\u2019s expressive black eyes. \u201cWhy, you are like a magician,\u201d said she. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\u2019 thin, eager face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,\u201d said he. \u201cI shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. \u201cNow we shall go upstairs,\u201d said he at last.\r\n\r\nThe banker\u2019s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich key was used to open it?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat which my son himself indicated\u2014that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you it here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is it on the dressing-table.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a noiseless lock,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.\u201d He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\u2019s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Holmes, \u201chere is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \u201cI should not dream of trying,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I will.\u201d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. \u201cI feel it give a little,\u201d said he; \u201cbut, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that I still share my uncle\u2019s perplexity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\u201d said he; \u201cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe banker wrung his hands. \u201cI shall never see them again!\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd my son? You give me hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy opinion is in no way altered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for God\u2019s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would give my fortune to have them back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\u2019s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that this should do,\u201d said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. \u201cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won\u2019t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.\u201d He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\r\n\r\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\u201cI only looked in as I passed,\u201d said he. \u201cI am going right on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don\u2019t wait up for me in case I should be late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\r\n\r\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it is after nine now,\u201d I answered. \u201cI should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\u201d said he. \u201cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDeserted you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MY DEAREST UNCLE,\u2014I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MARY.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would not think \u00a3 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would pay ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for \u00a3 4000.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cI am saved! I am saved!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOwe!\u201d He caught up a pen. \u201cName the sum, and I will pay it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it was not Arthur who took them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Mary? Impossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England\u2014a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!\u201d cried the banker with an ashen face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants\u2019 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible?\u201d gasped the banker.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\u201d cried Mr. Holder. \u201cOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the house,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cI at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen\u2019s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret\u2014the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\u2019s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\u201d said Mr. Holder.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held\u2014\u00a3 1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. \u2018Why, dash it all!\u2019 said he, \u2018I\u2019ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\u2019 I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at \u00a3 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\u2019clock, after what I may call a really hard day\u2019s work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\u201d said the banker, rising. \u201cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that we may safely say,\u201d returned Holmes, \u201cthat she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.\u201d\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the man who loves art for its own sake,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of The Daily Telegraph, \u201cit is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said I, smiling, \u201cI cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have erred, perhaps,\u201d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood\u2014\u201cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\u201d I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\u2019s singular character.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,\u201d said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \u201cIf I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing\u2014a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \u201cyou can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe end may have been so,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\u201d He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.\r\n\r\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR MR. HOLMES,\u2014I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201cVIOLET HUNTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know the young lady?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is half-past ten now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover\u2019s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\u201d said she, as my companion rose to greet her, \u201cbut I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been a governess for five years,\u201d said she, \u201cin the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit\u2019s end as to what I should do.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway\u2019s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That will do,\u2019 said he; \u2018I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!\u2019 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are looking for a situation, miss?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018As governess?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what salary do you ask?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had \u00a3 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, tut, tut! sweating\u2014rank sweating!\u2019 he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \u2018How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\u2019 said I. \u2018A little French, a little German, music, and drawing\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tut, tut!\u2019 he cried. \u2018This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at \u00a3 100 a year.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is also my custom,\u2019 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, \u2018to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018May I ask where you live, sir?\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One child\u2014one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!\u2019 He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was a little startled at the nature of the child\u2019s amusement, but the father\u2019s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My sole duties, then,\u2019 I asked, \u2018are to take charge of a single child?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to make myself useful.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know\u2014faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\u2019 said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that it is quite essential,\u2019 said he. \u2018It is a little fancy of my wife\u2019s, and ladies\u2019 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\u2019 fancies must be consulted. And so you won\u2019t cut your hair?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, sir, I really could not,\u2019 I answered firmly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\u2019 she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If you please, Miss Stoper.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,\u2019 said she sharply. \u2018You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.\u2019 She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting \u00a3 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\r\n\u201c\u2018DEAR MISS HUNTER,\u2014Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give \u00a3 30 a quarter, or \u00a3 120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,\u201d said Holmes, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a possible solution\u2014in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes, of course the pay is good\u2014too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you \u00a3 120 a year, when they could have their pick for \u00a3 40? There must be some strong reason behind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDanger! What danger do you foresee?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \u201cIt would cease to be a danger if we could define it,\u201d said he. \u201cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is enough.\u201d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. \u201cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\u201d With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt least,\u201d said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, \u201cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she would need to be,\u201d said Holmes gravely. \u201cI am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before my friend\u2019s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \u201cData! data! data!\u201d he cried impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t make bricks without clay.\u201d And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\r\n\r\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,\u201d said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\r\n\r\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,\u201d it said. \u201cDo come! I am at my wit\u2019s end.\r\n\r\n\u201cHUNTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d asked Holmes, glancing up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should wish to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look it up, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a train at half-past nine,\u201d said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. \u201cIt is due at Winchester at 11:30.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\u2019s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\u201d I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\r\n\r\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cWho would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\u2019s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. She has her freedom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am so delighted that you have come,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cIt is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray tell us what has happened to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us have everything in its due order.\u201d Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can you not understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton\u2019s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father\u2019s young wife.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad of all details,\u201d remarked my friend, \u201cwhether they seem to you to be relevant or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, turning to me, \u2018we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense r\u00e9pertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Jephro,\u2019 said she, \u2018there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I know no one in these parts.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Surely it would be better to take no notice.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray continue,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour narrative promises to be a most interesting one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look in here!\u2019 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. \u2018Is he not a beauty?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be frightened,\u2019 said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. \u2018It\u2019s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\u2019s as much as your life is worth.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o\u2019clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI assured him that I was not offended. \u2018By the way,\u2019 said I, \u2018you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Photography is one of my hobbies,\u2019 said he. \u2018I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\u2019 He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty\u2014a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\u2019s instinct; perhaps it was woman\u2019s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran\u2014ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018So,\u2019 said he, smiling, \u2018it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I am so frightened!\u2019 I panted.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\u2019\u2014you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was\u2014\u2018and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\u2019 I answered. \u2018But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Only that?\u2019 said he, looking at me keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what did you think?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why do you think that I lock this door?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure that I do not know.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\u2019 He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure if I had known\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again\u2019\u2014here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\u2014\u2018I\u2019ll throw you to the mastiff.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\u2019clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Toller still drunk?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the wine-cellar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will try. What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\u2019clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers\u2014possibly her fianc\u00e9\u2014and no doubt, as you wore the girl\u2019s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\u2019t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child\u2019s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\u2019s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\u201d cried our client. \u201cA thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o\u2019clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you managed it?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \u201cThat is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,\u201d said she. \u201cHer husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done well indeed!\u201d cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \u201cNow lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes\u2019 face clouded over.\r\n\r\n\u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he. \u201cI think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been some villainy here,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthis beauty has guessed Miss Hunter\u2019s intentions and has carried his victim off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\u201d He swung himself up onto the roof. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he cried, \u201chere\u2019s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is impossible,\u201d said Miss Hunter; \u201cthe ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou villain!\u201d said he, \u201cwhere\u2019s your daughter?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is for me to ask you that,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\u2019ll serve you!\u201d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone for the dog!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have my revolver,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter close the front door,\u201d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he cried. \u201cSomeone has loosed the dog. It\u2019s not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle\u2019s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\u2019t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \u201cIt is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will soon make it clear to you,\u201d said she; \u201cand I\u2019d have done so before now if I could ha\u2019 got out from the cellar. If there\u2019s police-court business over this, you\u2019ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\u2019s friend too.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\u2019t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend\u2019s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\u2019s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn\u2019t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\u2019s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\u2019t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said Mrs. Toller serenely.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cfor you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle\u2019s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o\u2019clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener\u2019s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, \u2018One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the gardener\u2019s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, \u2018Do not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean.\u2019 But the son thought to himself, \u2018What can such a beast as this know about the matter?\u2019 So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor. \u2018I should be very silly,\u2019 said he, \u2018if I went to that shabby house, and left this charming place\u2019; so he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\r\n\r\nTime passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner.\r\n\r\nTime passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, \u2018Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.\u2019 So he sat down, and the fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the village, the son followed the fox\u2019s counsel, and without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he was beginning his journey, and said, \u2018Go straight forward, till you come to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise you will repent it.\u2019 Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nBefore the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, \u2018It will be a very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage\u2019; so he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage. But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird given him for his own.\r\n\r\nSo he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair, when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, \u2018You see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.\u2019 Then the son sat down on the fox\u2019s tail, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nAll went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it. \u2018I will give him the good one,\u2019 said he; \u2018I am sure he deserves it.\u2019 As he took up the golden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own.\r\n\r\nThen he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, \u2018Why did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve o\u2019clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.\u2019 Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again.\r\n\r\nAs they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o\u2019clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last he consented; but the moment she came to her father\u2019s house the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again.\r\n\r\nThen he was brought before the king, and the king said, \u2018You shall never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops the view from my window.\u2019 Now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said. \u2018Lie down and go to sleep; I will work for you.\u2019 And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone; so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was removed he must give him the princess.\r\n\r\nThen the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, \u2018We will have all three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the young man, \u2018that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018If you will only listen,\u2019 said the fox, \u2018it can be done. When you come to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, \u201cHere she is!\u201d Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as fast as you can.\u2019\r\n\r\nAll went right: then the fox said, \u2018When you come to the castle where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away.\u2019\r\n\r\nThis, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox came, and said, \u2018Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.\u2019 But the young man refused to do it: so the fox said, \u2018I will at any rate give you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows, and sit down by the side of no river.\u2019 Then away he went. \u2018Well,\u2019 thought the young man, \u2018it is no hard matter to keep that advice.\u2019\r\n\r\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, \u2018Two men are going to be hanged.\u2019 As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, \u2018Cannot they in any way be saved?\u2019 But the people said \u2018No,\u2019 unless he would bestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were given up, and went on with him towards their home.\r\n\r\nAnd as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, \u2018Let us sit down by the side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.\u2019 So he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and forgot the fox\u2019s counsel, and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went home to the king their master, and said. \u2018All this have we won by our labour.\u2019 Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.\r\n\r\nThe youngest son fell to the bottom of the river\u2019s bed: luckily it was nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would have befallen him: \u2018Yet,\u2019 said he, \u2018I cannot leave you here, so lay hold of my tail and hold fast.\u2019 Then he pulled him out of the river, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, \u2018Your brothers have set watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.\u2019 So he dressed himself as a poor man, and came secretly to the king\u2019s court, and was scarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers\u2019 roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king\u2019s death he was heir to his kingdom.\r\n\r\nA long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the princess, who had been lost a great many many years.\r\nHANS IN LUCK\r\n\r\nSome men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right\u2014all that falls to them is so much gain\u2014all their geese are swans\u2014all their cards are trumps\u2014toss them which way you will, they will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it know about the matter?\r\n\r\nOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had worked hard for his master. At last he said, \u2018Master, my time is up; I must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go.\u2019 And the master said, \u2018You have been a faithful and good servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.\u2019 Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head.\r\n\r\nHans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said Hans aloud, \u2018what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.\u2019 Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, \u2018Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018I have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can\u2019t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.\u2019 \u2018What do you say of making an exchange?\u2019 said the horseman. \u2018I will give you my horse, and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said Hans: \u2018but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing\u2014you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.\u2019 However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, \u2018When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry \u201cJip!\u201d\u2019\r\n\r\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\r\n\r\n\u2018No care and no sorrow,\r\nA fig for the morrow!\r\nWe\u2019ll laugh and be merry,\r\nSing neigh down derry!\u2019\r\n\r\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips and cried \u2018Jip!\u2019 Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the shepherd, \u2018This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break his neck. However, I\u2019m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one\u2019s leisure behind that cow\u2014keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day, into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the shepherd, \u2018if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself.\u2019 \u2018Done!\u2019 said Hans, merrily. \u2018What a noble heart that good man has!\u2019 thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans and the cow good morning, and away he rode.\r\n\r\nHans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one. \u2018If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?\u2019 When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother\u2019s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. \u2018I can find a cure for this,\u2019 thought he; \u2018now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst\u2019: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that.\r\n\r\nWhile he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow. \u2018What is the matter with you, my man?\u2019 said the butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, \u2018There, drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don\u2019t you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?\u2019 \u2018Alas, alas!\u2019 said Hans, \u2018who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now\u2014like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease\u2014one could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the butcher, \u2018I don\u2019t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat pig for the cow.\u2019 \u2018Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!\u2019 said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.\r\n\r\nSo on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all. How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got?\r\n\r\nThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The countryman stopped to ask what was o\u2019clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a christening. \u2018Feel,\u2019 said he, \u2018how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 said Hans, as he weighed it in his hand; \u2018but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.\u2019 Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. \u2018Hark ye!\u2019 said he, \u2018my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can\u2019t help doing you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire\u2019s pig. If you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?\u2019\r\n\r\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened. \u2018Good man,\u2019 cried he, \u2018pray get me out of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born; but he may have been the squire\u2019s for aught I can tell: you know this country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.\u2019 \u2018I ought to have something into the bargain,\u2019 said the countryman; \u2018give a fat goose for a pig, indeed! \u2018Tis not everyone would do so much for you as that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.\u2019 Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. \u2018After all,\u2019 thought he, \u2018that chap is pretty well taken in. I don\u2019t care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.\u2019\r\n\r\nAs he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel, working and singing,\r\n\r\n\u2018O\u2019er hill and o\u2019er dale\r\nSo happy I roam,\r\nWork light and live well,\r\nAll the world is my home;\r\nThen who so blythe, so merry as I?\u2019\r\n\r\nHans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, \u2018You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the other, \u2018mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it\u2014but where did you get that beautiful goose?\u2019 \u2018I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.\u2019 \u2018And where did you get the pig?\u2019 \u2018I gave a cow for it.\u2019 \u2018And the cow?\u2019 \u2018I gave a horse for it.\u2019 \u2018And the horse?\u2019 \u2018I gave a lump of silver as big as my head for it.\u2019 \u2018And the silver?\u2019 \u2018Oh! I worked hard for that seven long years.\u2019 \u2018You have thriven well in the world hitherto,\u2019 said the grinder, \u2018now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand in it, your fortune would be made.\u2019 \u2018Very true: but how is that to be managed?\u2019 \u2018How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,\u2019 said the other; \u2018you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one that is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the value of your goose for it\u2014will you buy?\u2019 \u2018How can you ask?\u2019 said Hans; \u2018I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there\u2019s the goose.\u2019 \u2018Now,\u2019 said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone that lay by his side, \u2018this is a most capital stone; do but work it well enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.\u2019\r\n\r\nHans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, \u2018Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself. People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.\u2019\r\n\r\nMeantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his last penny in his joy at getting the cow.\r\n\r\nAt last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of water, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.\r\n\r\nFor a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone.\r\n\r\n\u2018How happy am I!\u2019 cried he; \u2018nobody was ever so lucky as I.\u2019 Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother\u2019s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.\r\nJORINDA AND JORINDEL\r\n\r\nThere was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them.\r\n\r\nNow there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, \u2018We must take care that we don\u2019t go too near to the fairy\u2019s castle.\u2019 It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches.\r\n\r\nJorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled. Jorinda was just singing,\r\n\r\n \u2018The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\r\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\r\n  He mourn\u2019d for the fate of his darling mate,\r\n  Well-a-day!\u2019\r\n\r\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended with a mournful jug, jug. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them, and three times screamed:\r\n\r\n \u2018Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!\u2019\r\n\r\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.\r\n\r\nShe mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone\u2014but what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n \u2018Till the prisoner is fast,\r\n  And her doom is cast,\r\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\r\n  When the charm is around her,\r\n  And the spell has bound her,\r\n  Hie away! away!\u2019\r\n\r\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her way.\r\n\r\nHe prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. \u2018Alas!\u2019 he said, \u2018what will become of me?\u2019 He could not go back to his own home, so he went to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\r\n\r\nAt last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found his Jorinda again.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and night, till he came again to the castle.\r\n\r\nHe walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.\r\n\r\nThen he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy\u2019s cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.\r\nTHE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS\r\n\r\nAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey towards the great city, \u2018For there,\u2019 thought he, \u2018I may turn musician.\u2019\r\n\r\nAfter he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the roadside and panting as if he were tired. \u2018What makes you pant so, my friend?\u2019 said the ass. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the dog, \u2018my master was going to knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?\u2019 \u2018Hark ye!\u2019 said the ass, \u2018I am going to the great city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can do in the same way?\u2019 The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on together.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face. \u2018Pray, my good lady,\u2019 said the ass, \u2018what\u2019s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!\u2019 \u2018Ah, me!\u2019 said the cat, \u2018how can one be in good spirits when one\u2019s life is in danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the ass, \u2018by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.\u2019 The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main. \u2018Bravo!\u2019 said the ass; \u2018upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what is all this about?\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 said the cock, \u2018I was just now saying that we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the cook don\u2019t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!\u2019 \u2018Heaven forbid!\u2019 said the ass, \u2018come with us Master Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\r\n\r\nThey could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions said, \u2018There must be a house no great way off, for I see a light.\u2019 \u2018If that be the case,\u2019 said the ass, \u2018we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the best in the world!\u2019 \u2018Besides,\u2019 added the dog, \u2018I should not be the worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.\u2019 So they walked off together towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers lived.\r\n\r\nThe ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and peeped in. \u2018Well, Donkey,\u2019 said Chanticleer, \u2018what do you see?\u2019 \u2018What do I see?\u2019 replied the ass. \u2018Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.\u2019 \u2018That would be a noble lodging for us,\u2019 said the cock. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the ass, \u2018if we could only get in\u2019; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog\u2019s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat\u2019s head. When all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert, had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them, and scampered away as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nThe coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBut about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, \u2018Throw the rascal up here!\u2019 After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.\r\nOLD SULTAN\r\n\r\nA shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife were standing together before the house the shepherd said, \u2018I will shoot old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.\u2019 But his wife said, \u2018Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his days.\u2019 \u2018But what can we do with him?\u2019 said the shepherd, \u2018he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves don\u2019t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.\u2019\r\n\r\nPoor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows, and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. \u2018Make yourself easy,\u2019 said the wolf, \u2018I will give you some good advice. Your master, you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live.\u2019 The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, \u2018Old Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on as long as he lives.\u2019 So from this time forward Sultan had all that he could wish for.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, \u2018Now, my good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way when I want to taste one of the old shepherd\u2019s fine fat sheep.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the Sultan; \u2018I will be true to my master.\u2019 However, the wolf thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed his locks for him finely.\r\n\r\nThen the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan \u2018an old rogue,\u2019 and swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd\u2019s old three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.\r\n\r\nThe wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat\u2019s long tail standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, \u2018Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.\u2019 So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.\r\nTHE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\r\n\r\nIn a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: \u2018Dear friends, from whence do you come here?\u2019 The coal replied: \u2018I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,\u2014I should have been burnt to ashes.\u2019 The bean said: \u2018I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.\u2019 \u2018And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?\u2019 said the straw. \u2018The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018But what are we to do now?\u2019 said the coal.\r\n\r\n\u2018I think,\u2019 answered the bean, \u2018that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair to a foreign country.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: \u2018I will lay myself straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.\u2019 The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.\r\nBRIAR ROSE\r\n\r\nA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off, where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, \u2018I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me\u2014you will soon have a daughter.\u2019 What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen said, \u2018I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good to our little daughter.\u2019 Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the world.\r\n\r\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall. Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge. So she cried out, \u2018The king\u2019s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.\u2019 Then the twelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king\u2019s daughter, when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew her loved her.\r\n\r\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily. \u2018Why, how now, good mother,\u2019 said the princess; \u2018what are you doing there?\u2019 \u2018Spinning,\u2019 said the old lady, and nodded her head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. \u2018How prettily that little thing turns round!\u2019 said the princess, and took the spindle and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the fairy\u2019s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell down lifeless on the ground.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king\u2019s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\r\n\r\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose (for so the king\u2019s daughter was called): so that, from time to time, several kings\u2019 sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\r\n\r\nAfter many, many years there came a king\u2019s son into that land: and an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose, lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died. Then the young prince said, \u2018All this shall not frighten me; I will go and see this Briar Rose.\u2019 The old man tried to hinder him, but he was bent upon going.\r\n\r\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going to beat the boy.\r\n\r\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay, fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss. But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder. And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king\u2019s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear.\r\n\r\nAnd then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.\r\nTHE DOG AND THE SPARROW\r\n\r\nA shepherd\u2019s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, \u2018Why are you so sad, my friend?\u2019 \u2018Because,\u2019 said the dog, \u2018I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.\u2019 \u2018If that be all,\u2019 answered the sparrow, \u2018come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.\u2019 So on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher\u2019s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, \u2018Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.\u2019 So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the sparrow, \u2018you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.\u2019 When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, \u2018Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?\u2019 \u2018I have had plenty of meat,\u2019 answered he, \u2018but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.\u2019 \u2018Come with me then,\u2019 said the sparrow, \u2018and you shall soon have that too.\u2019 So she took him to a baker\u2019s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said he; \u2018and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.\u2019 So they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog said, \u2018I am very much tired\u2014I should like to take a nap.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 answered the sparrow, \u2018do so, and in the meantime I will perch upon that bush.\u2019 So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, \u2018Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.\u2019 But the carter, grumbling to himself, \u2018You make it the worse for me, indeed! what can you do?\u2019 cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. \u2018There,\u2019 cried the sparrow, \u2018thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.\u2019 \u2018Do your worst, and welcome,\u2019 said the brute, \u2018what harm can you do me?\u2019 and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty. \u2018What an unlucky wretch I am!\u2019 cried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse\u2019s head with such force, that he fell down dead. \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 cried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, \u2018Miserable wretch that I am!\u2019 But the sparrow answered, \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 and perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot. \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 said he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two. \u2018Alas! miserable wretch that I am!\u2019 cried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 answered the sparrow as she flew away; \u2018now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.\u2019 The carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said he to his wife, \u2018what ill luck has befallen me!\u2014my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead.\u2019 \u2018Alas! husband,\u2019 replied she, \u2018and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a rate!\u2019 Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them. \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the sparrow; \u2018thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!\u2019 and away she flew.\r\n\r\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried \u2018Carter! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!\u2019 With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and cried, \u2018Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!\u2019 Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the wife said, \u2018Shall I kill her at once?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 cried he, \u2018that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her.\u2019 But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, \u2018Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!\u2019 With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, \u2018Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.\u2019 And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.\r\nTHE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\r\n\r\nThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been.\r\n\r\nThen the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\r\n\r\nA king\u2019s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open. But the king\u2019s son soon fell asleep; and when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck, and all lost their lives in the same manner.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. \u2018I hardly know where I am going, or what I had better do,\u2019 said the soldier; \u2018but I think I should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time I might be a king.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the old dame, \u2018that is no very hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves you pretend to be fast asleep.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, \u2018As soon as you put that on you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the princesses wherever they go.\u2019 When the soldier heard all this good counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said he was willing to undertake the task.\r\n\r\nHe was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, \u2018This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!\u2019 Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing. But the youngest said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will befall us.\u2019 \u2018You simpleton,\u2019 said the eldest, \u2018you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings\u2019 sons have already watched in vain? And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping draught, he would have slept soundly enough.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, \u2018All is not right; someone took hold of my gown.\u2019 \u2018You silly creature!\u2019 said the eldest, \u2018it is nothing but a nail in the wall.\u2019 Then down they all went, and at the bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully. The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the youngest daughter said again, \u2018I am sure all is not right\u2014did not you hear that noise? That never happened before.\u2019 But the eldest said, \u2018It is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy. So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them, who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\r\n\r\nOne of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said, \u2018I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today.\u2019 \u2018It is only the heat of the weather,\u2019 said the princess: \u2018I feel it very warm too.\u2019\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced her. They danced on till three o\u2019clock in the morning, and then all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off. The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising to come again the next night.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses, and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, \u2018Now all is quite safe\u2019; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However, on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say. And when the king asked him. \u2018Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?\u2019 he answered, \u2018With twelve princes in a castle under ground.\u2019 And then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he answered, \u2018I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.\u2019\u2014And they were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king\u2019s heir.\r\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE\r\n\r\nThere was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish. But the fish said, \u2018Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!\u2019 \u2018Oh, ho!\u2019 said the man, \u2018you need not make so many words about the matter; I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!\u2019 Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave.\r\n\r\nWhen the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. \u2018Did not you ask it for anything?\u2019 said the wife, \u2018we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green. And he stood at the water\u2019s edge, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the fish came swimming to him, and said, \u2018Well, what is her will? What does your wife want?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018she says that when I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug little cottage.\u2019 \u2018Go home, then,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is in the cottage already!\u2019 So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage. \u2018Come in, come in!\u2019 said she; \u2018is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?\u2019 And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018how happily we shall live now!\u2019 \u2018We will try to do so, at least,\u2019 said his wife.\r\n\r\nEverything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said, \u2018Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle.\u2019 \u2018Wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018I don\u2019t like to go to him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty cottage to live in.\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said the wife; \u2018he will do it very willingly, I know; go along and try!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Well, what does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the man, dolefully, \u2018my wife wants to live in a stone castle.\u2019 \u2018Go home, then,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is standing at the gate of it already.\u2019 So away went the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle. \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018is not this grand?\u2019 With that they went into the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow-houses. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the man, \u2018now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps we may,\u2019 said the wife; \u2018but let us sleep upon it, before we make up our minds to that.\u2019 So they went to bed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, \u2018Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019 said the man, \u2018why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.\u2019 \u2018Then I will,\u2019 said she. \u2018But, wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018how can you be king\u2014the fish cannot make you a king?\u2019 \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018say no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.\u2019 So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out:\r\n\r\n \u2018O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Well, what would she have now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the poor man, \u2018my wife wants to be king.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is king already.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. \u2018Well, wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018are you king?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am king.\u2019 And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, \u2018Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know how that may be,\u2019 said she; \u2018never is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I think I should like to be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor?\u2019 said the fisherman. \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018go to the fish! I say I will be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Ah, wife!\u2019 replied the fisherman, \u2018the fish cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing.\u2019 \u2018I am king,\u2019 said Ilsabill, \u2018and you are my slave; so go at once!\u2019\r\n\r\nSo the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, \u2018This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.\u2019 He soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near as he could to the water\u2019s brink, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018What would she have now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018she wants to be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is emperor already.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went up to her and said, \u2018Wife, are you emperor?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am emperor.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the man, as he gazed upon her, \u2018what a fine thing it is to be emperor!\u2019 \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018why should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope next.\u2019 \u2018O wife, wife!\u2019 said he, \u2018how can you be pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.\u2019 \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018I will be pope this very day.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 replied the husband, \u2018the fish cannot make you pope.\u2019 \u2018What nonsense!\u2019 said she; \u2018if he can make an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018What does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018my wife wants to be pope.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is pope already.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight. \u2018Wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness, \u2018are you pope?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am pope.\u2019 \u2018Well, wife,\u2019 replied he, \u2018it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.\u2019 \u2018I will think about that,\u2019 said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. \u2018Ha!\u2019 thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, \u2018after all I cannot prevent the sun rising.\u2019 At this thought she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and said, \u2018Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of the sun and moon.\u2019 The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed. \u2018Alas, wife!\u2019 said he, \u2018cannot you be easy with being pope?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the fish at once!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea, and cried out, as well as he could:\r\n\r\n \u2018O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018What does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018she wants to be lord of the sun and moon.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish, \u2018to your pigsty again.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd there they live to this very day.\r\nTHE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR\r\n\r\nOnce in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: \u2018Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?\u2019 \u2018That is the King of birds,\u2019 said the wolf, \u2018before whom we must bow down.\u2019 In reality the bird was the willow-wren. \u2018IF that\u2019s the case,\u2019 said the bear, \u2018I should very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.\u2019 \u2018That is not done quite as you seem to think,\u2019 said the wolf; \u2018you must wait until the Queen comes,\u2019 Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: \u2018No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.\u2019 So they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there. \u2018Is that the royal palace?\u2019 cried the bear; \u2018it is a wretched palace, and you are not King\u2019s children, you are disreputable children!\u2019 When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed: \u2018No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: \u2018We will not so much as touch one fly\u2019s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!\u2019 Then the old King said: \u2018Be easy, he shall be punished,\u2019 and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear\u2019s cave, and called in: \u2018Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall suffer for it\u2014we will punish you by a bloody war.\u2019 Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy\u2019s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said: \u2018Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be general and lead us.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 said the fox, \u2018but what signal shall we agree upon?\u2019 No one knew that, so the fox said: \u2018I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.\u2019 When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox\u2019s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\r\n\r\nThen the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried: \u2018Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart\u2019s content, we have won the battle!\u2019 But the young wrens said: \u2018We will not eat yet, the bear must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable children, before we will do that.\u2019 Then the willow-wren flew to the bear\u2019s hole and cried: \u2018Growler, you are to come to the nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall be broken.\u2019 So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the night.\r\nTHE FROG-PRINCE\r\n\r\nOne fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail her loss, and said, \u2018Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, \u2018Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she, \u2018what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.\u2019 The frog said, \u2018I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again.\u2019 \u2018What nonsense,\u2019 thought the princess, \u2018this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.\u2019 So she said to the frog, \u2018Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.\u2019 Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could. The frog called after her, \u2018Stay, princess, and take me with you as you said,\u2019 But she did not stop to hear a word.\r\n\r\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise\u2014tap, tap\u2014plash, plash\u2014as if something was coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her, asked her what was the matter. \u2018There is a nasty frog,\u2019 said she, \u2018at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the king said to the young princess, \u2018As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.\u2019 She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on\u2014tap, tap\u2014plash, plash\u2014from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the princess sat. \u2018Pray lift me upon chair,\u2019 said he to the princess, \u2018and let me sit next to you.\u2019 As soon as she had done this, the frog said, \u2018Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.\u2019 This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, \u2018Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.\u2019 And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. \u2018Now, then,\u2019 thought the princess, \u2018at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head of her bed.\r\n\r\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. \u2018You,\u2019 said the prince, \u2018have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father\u2019s kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying \u2018Yes\u2019 to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the prince\u2019s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\r\n\r\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince\u2019s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.\r\nCAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r\n\r\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. \u2018But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,\u2019 said the cat; \u2018and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.\u2019 The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: \u2018I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.\u2019 So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: \u2018I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.\u2019 \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 answered the mouse, \u2018by all means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.\u2019 All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home. \u2018Well, here you are again,\u2019 said the mouse, \u2018no doubt you have had a merry day.\u2019 \u2018All went off well,\u2019 answered the cat. \u2018What name did they give the child?\u2019 \u2018Top off!\u2019 said the cat quite coolly. \u2018Top off!\u2019 cried the mouse, \u2018that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?\u2019 \u2018What does that matter,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.\u2019\r\n\r\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to the mouse: \u2018You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\u2019 The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. \u2018Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,\u2019 said she, and was quite satisfied with her day\u2019s work. When she went home the mouse inquired: \u2018And what was the child christened?\u2019 \u2018Half-done,\u2019 answered the cat. \u2018Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my life, I\u2019ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe cat\u2019s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. \u2018All good things go in threes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am asked to stand godmother again. The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Top-off! Half-done!\u2019 answered the mouse, \u2018they are such odd names, they make me very thoughtful.\u2019 \u2018You sit at home,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that\u2019s because you do not go out in the daytime.\u2019 During the cat\u2019s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat. \u2018When everything is eaten up one has some peace,\u2019 said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child. \u2018It will not please you more than the others,\u2019 said the cat. \u2018He is called All-gone.\u2019 \u2018All-gone,\u2019 cried the mouse \u2018that is the most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone; what can that mean?\u2019 and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: \u2018Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves\u2014we shall enjoy that.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered the cat, \u2018you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.\u2019 They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the mouse, \u2018now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then half-done, then\u2014\u2019 \u2018Will you hold your tongue,\u2019 cried the cat, \u2018one word more, and I will eat you too.\u2019 \u2018All-gone\u2019 was already on the poor mouse\u2019s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of the world.\r\nTHE GOOSE-GIRL\r\n\r\nThe king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom\u2019s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess\u2019s horse was the fairy\u2019s gift, and it was called Falada, and could speak.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and gave it to the princess, and said, \u2018Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.\u2019 Then they all took a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her bridegroom\u2019s kingdom.\r\n\r\nOne day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, \u2018Pray get down, and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.\u2019 \u2018Nay,\u2019 said the maid, \u2018if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer.\u2019 Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out her golden cup; and she wept and said, \u2018Alas! what will become of me?\u2019 And the lock answered her, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her maid\u2019s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\r\n\r\nThen all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid\u2019s rude speech, and said, \u2018Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup.\u2019 But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before: \u2018Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.\u2019 Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said, \u2018What will become of me?\u2019 And the lock of hair answered her again:\r\n\r\n \u2018Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid said, \u2018I shall ride upon Falada, and you may have my horse instead\u2019; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid\u2019s shabby ones.\r\n\r\nAt last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\r\n\r\nThen the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\r\n\r\nNow the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in the court below. \u2018I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the road,\u2019 said she; \u2018pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle.\u2019 The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to do; but at last he said, \u2018I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.\u2019 Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the king\u2019s geese, was Curdken.\r\n\r\nBut the false bride said to the prince, \u2018Dear husband, pray do me one piece of kindness.\u2019 \u2018That I will,\u2019 said the prince. \u2018Then tell one of your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road\u2019; but the truth was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada\u2019s head against a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the dark gate.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate, she said sorrowfully:\r\n\r\n \u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\u2019\r\n\r\nand the head answered:\r\n\r\n \u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the locks out, but she cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken\u2019s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl\u2019d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb\u2019d and curl\u2019d!\r\n\r\nThen there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken\u2019s hat; and away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor girl looked up at Falada\u2019s head, and cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\u2019\r\n\r\nand the head answered:\r\n\r\n \u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\r\n\r\n \u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken\u2019s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl\u2019d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb\u2019d and curl\u2019d!\r\n\r\nThen the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way, over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they watched the geese till it grew dark.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and said, \u2018I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any longer.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said the king. \u2018Because, instead of doing any good, she does nothing but tease me all day long.\u2019 Then the king made him tell him what had happened. And Curdken said, \u2018When we go in the morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\r\n\r\n \u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\u2019\r\n\r\nand the head answers:\r\n\r\n \u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid himself in a bush by the meadow\u2019s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her say:\r\n\r\n \u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken\u2019s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl\u2019d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb\u2019d and curl\u2019d!\r\n\r\nAnd soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken\u2019s hat, and away went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside, and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, \u2018That I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\r\n\r\nWhen they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave thus. \u2018Nothing better,\u2019 said this false bride, \u2018than that she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was dead.\u2019 \u2018Thou art she!\u2019 said the old king; \u2018and as thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.\u2019 And the young king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET\r\n\r\n1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\r\n\r\n\u2018The nuts are quite ripe now,\u2019 said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet, \u2018suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can, before the squirrel takes them all away.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said Partlet, \u2018let us go and make a holiday of it together.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not, I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home. \u2018That\u2019s a good joke!\u2019 said Chanticleer; \u2018no, that will never do; I had rather by half walk home; I\u2019ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I\u2019ll not draw.\u2019 While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, \u2018You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I\u2019ll give it you well for your insolence!\u2019 and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck\u2019s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, \u2018Now, duck, get on as fast as you can.\u2019 And away they went at a pretty good pace.\r\n\r\nAfter they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, \u2018Stop, stop!\u2019 and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to tread on Partlet\u2019s toes.\r\n\r\nLate at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company: however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep, and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord\u2019s easy chair and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him. \u2018Bless me!\u2019 said he, \u2018all the world seems to have a design against my head this morning\u2019: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\r\n\r\n2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\r\n\r\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together; so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage, and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 And Chanticleer replied,\r\n\r\n \u2018All on our way\r\n  A visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the cat said, \u2018Take me with you,\u2019 Chanticleer said, \u2018With all my heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.\u2019\r\n\r\n \u2018Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\r\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\r\n  Now, mice, be ready,\r\n  And, wheels, run steady!\r\n  For we are going a visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.\u2019\r\n\r\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with them.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Mr Korbes\u2019s house, he was not at home; so the mice drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself up in the towel.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot.\r\n\r\n3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\r\n\r\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, \u2018Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked.\u2019 Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and said, \u2018River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.\u2019 The river said, \u2018Run first to the bride, and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.\u2019 Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said, \u2018Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.\u2019 But the bride said, \u2018Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden.\u2019 Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any more.\r\n\r\nThen Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they met the fox. \u2018Where are you going, Chanticleer?\u2019 said he. \u2018To bury my Partlet,\u2019 said the other. \u2018May I go with you?\u2019 said the fox. \u2018Yes; but you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.\u2019 Then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\r\n\r\nSo on they went till they came to a rapid stream. \u2018How shall we get over?\u2019 said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, \u2018I will lay myself across, and you may pass over upon me.\u2019 But as the mice were going over, the straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came and said, \u2018I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you shall pass over upon me.\u2019 So he laid himself down; but they managed so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\r\n\r\nThus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her. Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too; and so all were dead.\r\nRAPUNZEL\r\n\r\nThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: \u2018What ails you, dear wife?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 she replied, \u2018if I can\u2019t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.\u2019 The man, who loved her, thought: \u2018Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.\u2019 At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her\u2014so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. \u2018How can you dare,\u2019 said she with angry look, \u2018descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 answered he, \u2018let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.\u2019 Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: \u2018If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.\u2019 The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\r\n\r\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.\u2019\r\n\r\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\r\n\r\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king\u2019s son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king\u2019s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. \u2018If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,\u2019 said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.\u2019\r\n\r\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king\u2019s son climbed up.\r\n\r\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king\u2019s son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: \u2018He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does\u2019; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: \u2018I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.\u2019 They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her: \u2018Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king\u2019s son\u2014he is with me in a moment.\u2019 \u2018Ah! you wicked child,\u2019 cried the enchantress. \u2018What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!\u2019 In her anger she clutched Rapunzel\u2019s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king\u2019s son came and cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.\u2019\r\n\r\nshe let the hair down. The king\u2019s son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks. \u2018Aha!\u2019 she cried mockingly, \u2018you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.\u2019 The king\u2019s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.\r\nFUNDEVOGEL\r\n\r\nThere was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\r\n\r\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself: \u2018You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.\u2019 He took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad.\r\n\r\nNow the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out to the spring. Lina saw this and said, \u2018Listen, old Sanna, why are you fetching so much water?\u2019 \u2018If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will tell you why.\u2019 So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone, and then the cook said: \u2018Early tomorrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.\u2019\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel: \u2018If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.\u2019 Fundevogel said: \u2018Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.\u2019 Then said Lina: \u2018Then will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly alarmed, and she said to herself: \u2018What shall I say now when the forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be followed instantly to get them back again.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and overtake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina said to Fundevogel: \u2018Never leave me, and I will never leave you.\u2019 Fundevogel said: \u2018Neither now, nor ever.\u2019 Then said Lina: \u2018Do you become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.\u2019 When the three servants came to the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but the children were nowhere. Then said they: \u2018There is nothing to be done here,\u2019 and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the old cook scolded and said: \u2018You simpletons, you should have cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with you; go, and do it at once.\u2019 They had therefore to go out and look for the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance. Then Lina said: \u2018Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave you.\u2019 Fundevogel said: \u2018Neither now; nor ever.\u2019 Said Lina: \u2018Then do you become a church, and I\u2019ll be the chandelier in it.\u2019 So when the three servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in it. They said therefore to each other: \u2018What can we do here, let us go home.\u2019 When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them; so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: \u2018You fools! why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?\u2019 And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however, saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling after them. Then said Lina: \u2018Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave you.\u2019 Then said Fundevogel: \u2018Neither now, nor ever.\u2019 Said Lina: \u2018Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.\u2019 The cook, however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it, and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old witch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.\r\nTHE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR\r\n\r\nOne summer\u2019s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came a peasant woman down the street crying: \u2018Good jams, cheap! Good jams, cheap!\u2019 This rang pleasantly in the tailor\u2019s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called: \u2018Come up here, dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods.\u2019 The woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said: \u2018The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence.\u2019 The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. \u2018Now, this jam shall be blessed by God,\u2019 cried the little tailor, \u2018and give me health and strength\u2019; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. \u2018This won\u2019t taste bitter,\u2019 said he, \u2018but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite.\u2019 He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts. \u2018Hi! who invited you?\u2019 said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however, who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying: \u2018Wait, and I will give it to you,\u2019 struck it mercilessly on them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. \u2018Are you a fellow of that sort?\u2019 said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. \u2018The whole town shall know of this!\u2019 And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: \u2018Seven at one stroke!\u2019 \u2018What, the town!\u2019 he continued, \u2018the whole world shall hear of it!\u2019 and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb\u2019s tail. The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away, he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him, and said: \u2018Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck. Have you any inclination to go with me?\u2019 The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: \u2018You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Oh, indeed?\u2019 answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and showed the giant the girdle, \u2018there may you read what kind of a man I am!\u2019 The giant read: \u2018Seven at one stroke,\u2019 and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it. \u2018Do that likewise,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018if you have strength.\u2019 \u2018Is that all?\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018that is child\u2019s play with us!\u2019 and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it. \u2018Faith,\u2019 said he, \u2018that was a little better, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it. \u2018Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise,\u2019 \u2018Well thrown,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all,\u2019 and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back. \u2018How does that shot please you, comrade?\u2019 asked the tailor. \u2018You can certainly throw,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.\u2019 He took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said: \u2018If you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.\u2019 \u2018Readily,\u2019 answered the little man; \u2018take you the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they are the heaviest.\u2019 The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: \u2018Three tailors rode forth from the gate,\u2019 as if carrying the tree were child\u2019s play. The giant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: \u2018Hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall!\u2019 The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said to the giant: \u2018You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry the tree!\u2019\r\n\r\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor\u2019s hand, and bade him eat. But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it. When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: \u2018What is this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?\u2019 \u2018There is no lack of strength,\u2019 answered the little tailor. \u2018Do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. Jump as I did, if you can do it.\u2019 The giant made the attempt but he could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.\r\n\r\nThe giant said: \u2018If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our cavern and spend the night with us.\u2019 The little tailor was willing, and followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: \u2018It is much more spacious here than in my workshop.\u2019 The giant showed him a bed, and said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into a corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified, they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a great hurry.\r\n\r\nThe little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose. After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and read on his girdle: \u2018Seven at one stroke.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said they, \u2018what does the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty lord.\u2019 They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal. \u2018For this very reason have I come here,\u2019 the tailor replied, \u2018I am ready to enter the king\u2019s service.\u2019 He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling was assigned him.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished him a thousand miles away. \u2018What is to be the end of this?\u2019 they said among themselves. \u2018If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him, seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against him.\u2019 They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to the king, and begged for their dismissal. \u2018We are not prepared,\u2019 said they, \u2018to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.\u2019 The king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him. \u2018That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!\u2019 thought the little tailor. \u2018One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one\u2019s life!\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I will soon subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers: \u2018Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.\u2019 Then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: \u2018Why are you knocking me?\u2019 \u2018You must be dreaming,\u2019 said the other, \u2018I am not knocking you.\u2019 They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second. \u2018What is the meaning of this?\u2019 cried the other \u2018Why are you pelting me?\u2019 \u2018I am not pelting you,\u2019 answered the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. \u2018That is too bad!\u2019 cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. \u2018It is a lucky thing,\u2019 said he, \u2018that they did not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.\u2019 He drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the horsemen and said: \u2018The work is done; I have finished both of them off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.\u2019 \u2018But are you not wounded?\u2019 asked the horsemen. \u2018You need not concern yourself about that,\u2019 answered the tailor, \u2018they have not bent one hair of mine.\u2019 The horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees.\r\n\r\nThe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however, repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get rid of the hero. \u2018Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my kingdom,\u2019 said he to him, \u2018you must perform one more heroic deed. In the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch it first.\u2019 \u2018I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one blow, is my kind of affair.\u2019 He took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more ado. \u2018Softly, softly; it can\u2019t be done as quickly as that,\u2019 said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught. \u2018Now, I have got the bird,\u2019 said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the king.\r\n\r\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their help. \u2018Willingly,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018that is child\u2019s play!\u2019 He did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window, was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a king was made.\r\n\r\nAfter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at night: \u2018Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I will rap the yard-measure over your ears.\u2019 Then she discovered in what state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her and said: \u2018Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide world.\u2019 The woman was satisfied with this; but the king\u2019s armour-bearer, who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of the whole plot. \u2018I\u2019ll put a screw into that business,\u2019 said the little tailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: \u2018Boy, make me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your ears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing outside the room.\u2019 When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against him. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his life.\r\nHANSEL AND GRETEL\r\n\r\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: \u2018What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what, husband,\u2019 answered the woman, \u2018early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\u2019 \u2018No, wife,\u2019 said the man, \u2018I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?\u2014the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\u2019 \u2018O, you fool!\u2019 said she, \u2018then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins,\u2019 and she left him no peace until he consented. \u2018But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\u2019 said the man.\r\n\r\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: \u2018Now all is over with us.\u2019 \u2018Be quiet, Gretel,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.\u2019 And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: \u2018Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\u2019 and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying: \u2018Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\u2019 She gave each a little piece of bread, and said: \u2018There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\u2019 Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said: \u2018Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.\u2019 \u2018Ah, father,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.\u2019 The wife said: \u2018Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\u2019 Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: \u2018Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\u2019 Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said: \u2018Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\u2019\r\n\r\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said: \u2018How are we to get out of the forest now?\u2019 But Hansel comforted her and said: \u2018Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\u2019 And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\r\n\r\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father\u2019s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: \u2018You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?\u2014we thought you were never coming back at all!\u2019 The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father: \u2018Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\u2019 The man\u2019s heart was heavy, and he thought: \u2018It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.\u2019 The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\r\n\r\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said: \u2018Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\u2019\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \u2018Hansel, why do you stop and look round?\u2019 said the father, \u2018go on.\u2019 \u2018I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me,\u2019 answered Hansel. \u2018Fool!\u2019 said the woman, \u2018that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\u2019 Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\r\n\r\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said: \u2018Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\u2019 When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: \u2018Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\u2019 When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: \u2018We shall soon find the way,\u2019 but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father\u2019s house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \u2018We will set to work on that,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\u2019 Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:\r\n\r\n \u2018Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\r\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?\u2019\r\n\r\nThe children answered:\r\n\r\n \u2018The wind, the wind,\r\n  The heaven-born wind,\u2019\r\n\r\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: \u2018Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\u2019 She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly: \u2018I have them, they shall not escape me again!\u2019 Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: \u2018That will be a dainty mouthful!\u2019 Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: \u2018Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\u2019 Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\r\n\r\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried: \u2018Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat.\u2019 Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel\u2019s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \u2018Now, then, Gretel,\u2019 she cried to the girl, \u2018stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.\u2019 Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! \u2018Dear God, do help us,\u2019 she cried. \u2018If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.\u2019 \u2018Just keep your noise to yourself,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018it won\u2019t help you at all.\u2019\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. \u2018We will bake first,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\u2019 She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. \u2018Creep in,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018and see if it is properly heated, so that we can put the bread in.\u2019 And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: \u2018I do not know how I am to do it; how do I get in?\u2019 \u2018Silly goose,\u2019 said the old woman. \u2018The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\u2019 and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.\r\n\r\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried: \u2018Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\u2019 Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch\u2019s house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. \u2018These are far better than pebbles!\u2019 said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: \u2018I, too, will take something home with me,\u2019 and filled her pinafore full. \u2018But now we must be off,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018that we may get out of the witch\u2019s forest.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water. \u2018We cannot cross,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\u2019 \u2018And there is also no ferry,\u2019 answered Gretel, \u2018but a white duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.\u2019 Then she cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\r\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\r\n  There\u2019s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\r\n  Take us across on thy back so white.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. \u2018No,\u2019 replied Gretel, \u2018that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\u2019 The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father\u2019s house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father\u2019s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\r\nTHE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores. The bird\u2019s duty was to fly daily into the wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw to the cooking.\r\n\r\nWhen people are too well off they always begin to long for something new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\r\n\r\nAnd now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another.\r\n\r\nSo now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\r\n\r\nPresently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable to recover himself, he was drowned.\r\nMOTHER HOLLE\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother, however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, \u2018As you have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\r\n\r\nShe remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming in every direction.\r\n\r\nShe walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker\u2019s oven full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, \u2018Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago.\u2019 So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\r\n\r\nShe went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples. \u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray,\u2019 cried the tree; \u2018my apples, one and all, are ripe.\u2019 So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again.\r\n\r\nThe next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, \u2018What are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful, however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.\u2019 The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service.\r\n\r\nShe took care to do everything according to the old woman\u2019s bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and boiled meats every day.\r\n\r\nSo she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, \u2018I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen Mother Holle said, \u2018I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself.\u2019\r\n\r\nThereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\u2018That is a reward for your industry,\u2019 said Mother Holle, and as she spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\r\n\r\nThe gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old world close to her mother\u2019s house. As she entered the courtyard, the cock who was perched on the well, called out:\r\n\r\n \u2018Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n  Your golden daughter\u2019s come back to you.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.\r\n\r\nLike her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till she came to the oven. \u2018Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,\u2019 cried the loaves as before. But the lazy girl answered, \u2018Do you think I am going to dirty my hands for you?\u2019 and walked on.\r\n\r\nPresently she came to the apple-tree. \u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray; my apples, one and all, are ripe,\u2019 it cried. But she only answered, \u2018A nice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,\u2019 and passed on.\r\n\r\nAt last she came to Mother Holle\u2019s house, and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged herself without delay to the old woman.\r\n\r\nThe first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to make the old woman\u2019s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and thought to herself, \u2018The gold will soon be mine.\u2019 Mother Holle led her, as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her.\r\n\r\n\u2018That is in return for your services,\u2019 said the old woman, and she shut the gate.\r\n\r\nSo the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the well called out as she saw her:\r\n\r\n \u2018Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n  Your dirty daughter\u2019s come back to you.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to her as long as she lived.\r\nLITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called \u2018Little Red-Cap.\u2019\r\n\r\nOne day her mother said to her: \u2018Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don\u2019t forget to say, \u201cGood morning\u201d, and don\u2019t peep into every corner before you do it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018I will take great care,\u2019 said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\r\n\r\n\u2018Good day, Little Red-Cap,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u2018Thank you kindly, wolf.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018To my grandmother\u2019s.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018What have you got in your apron?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,\u2019 replied Little Red-Cap.\r\n\r\nThe wolf thought to himself: \u2018What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful\u2014she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\u2019 So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: \u2018See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here\u2014why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\u2019\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: \u2018Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time\u2019; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\u2019s house and knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\u2018Who is there?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Little Red-Cap,\u2019 replied the wolf. \u2018She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Lift the latch,\u2019 called out the grandmother, \u2018I am too weak, and cannot get up.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother\u2019s bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\r\n\r\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: \u2018Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.\u2019 She called out: \u2018Good morning,\u2019 but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\r\n\r\n\u2018Oh! grandmother,\u2019 she said, \u2018what big ears you have!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018The better to hear you with, my child,\u2019 was the reply.\r\n\r\n\u2018But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\u2019 she said.\r\n\r\n\u2018The better to see you with, my dear.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018The better to hug you with.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018The better to eat you with!\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: \u2018How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.\u2019 So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \u2018Do I find you here, you old sinner!\u2019 said he. \u2018I have long sought you!\u2019 Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: \u2018Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf\u2019; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf\u2019s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\r\n\r\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf\u2019s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: \u2018As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\u2019\r\n\r\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said \u2018good morning\u2019 to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the grandmother, \u2018we will shut the door, that he may not come in.\u2019 Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: \u2018Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some cakes.\u2019 But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: \u2018Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.\u2019 Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.\r\nTHE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM\r\n\r\nThere was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for. He said to himself, \u2018I will give her to the first suitable man who comes and asks for her hand.\u2019 Not long after a suitor appeared, and as he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband. She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, \u2018You have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some time.\u2019 \u2018I do not know where your house is,\u2019 she answered. \u2018My house is out there in the dark forest,\u2019 he said. She tried to excuse herself by saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed only replied, \u2018You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I will strew ashes along the path.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest, darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers\u2019 lair.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a cage on the wall. Again it cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers\u2019 lair.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from shaking. \u2018Can you tell me,\u2019 asked the girl, \u2018if my betrothed husband lives here?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Ah, you poor child,\u2019 answered the old woman, \u2018what a place for you to come to! This is a murderers\u2019 den. You think yourself a promised bride, and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.\u2019\r\n\r\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her from view. \u2018Keep as still as a mouse,\u2019 she said; \u2018do not move or speak, or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an opportunity to escape.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned, dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.\r\n\r\nThe poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he could not find it. \u2018Have you looked behind the large cask?\u2019 said one of the others. But the old woman called out, \u2018Come and eat your suppers, and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won\u2019t run away.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018The old woman is right,\u2019 said the robbers, and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down.\r\n\r\nThe old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs, opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers\u2019 den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father all that had happened.\r\n\r\nThe day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast, each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did not say a word.\r\n\r\n\u2018And you, my love,\u2019 said the bridegroom, turning to her, \u2018is there no tale you know? Tell us something.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018I will tell you a dream, then,\u2019 said the bride. \u2018I went alone through a forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\r\n\r\n \u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers\u2019 lair.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd again a second time it said these words.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty, and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered, \u201cAh, you poor child, you are come to a murderers\u2019 den; your betrothed does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards cook and eat you.\u201d\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and yellow, and with that she died.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.\u2019 And with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the assembled guests.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were condemned to death for their wicked deeds.\r\nTOM THUMB\r\n\r\nA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. \u2018How lonely it is, wife,\u2019 said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, \u2018for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!\u2019 \u2018What you say is very true,\u2019 said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel; \u2018how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were ever so small\u2014nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb\u2014I should be very happy, and love it dearly.\u2019 Now\u2014odd as you may think it\u2014it came to pass that this good woman\u2019s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, \u2018Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly.\u2019 And they called him Thomas Thumb.\r\n\r\nThey gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born. Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\r\n\r\nOne day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel, he said, \u2018I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I want to make haste.\u2019 \u2018Oh, father,\u2019 cried Tom, \u2018I will take care of that; the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.\u2019 Then the woodman laughed, and said, \u2018How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse\u2019s bridle.\u2019 \u2018Never mind that, father,\u2019 said Tom; \u2018if my mother will only harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to go.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the father, \u2018we will try for once.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go, crying out, \u2018Go on!\u2019 and \u2018Stop!\u2019 as he wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom was calling out, \u2018Gently! gently!\u2019 two strangers came up. \u2018What an odd thing that is!\u2019 said one: \u2018there is a cart going along, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.\u2019 \u2018That is queer, indeed,\u2019 said the other; \u2018let us follow the cart, and see where it goes.\u2019 So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried out, \u2018See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take me down!\u2019 So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse\u2019s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please.\r\n\r\nThe two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, \u2018That little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.\u2019 So they went up to the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. \u2018He will be better off,\u2019 said they, \u2018with us than with you.\u2019 \u2018I won\u2019t sell him at all,\u2019 said the father; \u2018my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world.\u2019 But Tom, hearing of the bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father\u2019s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear, \u2018Take the money, father, and let them have me; I\u2019ll soon come back to you.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a large piece of gold, and they paid the price. \u2018Where would you like to sit?\u2019 said one of them. \u2018Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we go along.\u2019 So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his father they took him away with them.\r\n\r\nThey journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man said, \u2018Let me get down, I\u2019m tired.\u2019 So the man took off his hat, and put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into an old mouse-hole. \u2018Good night, my masters!\u2019 said he, \u2018I\u2019m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time.\u2019 Then they ran at once to the place, and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as sulky as could be.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. \u2018What dangerous walking it is,\u2019 said he, \u2018in this ploughed field! If I were to fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.\u2019 At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. \u2018This is lucky,\u2019 said he, \u2018I can sleep here very well\u2019; and in he crept.\r\n\r\nJust as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting together; and one said to the other, \u2018How can we rob that rich parson\u2019s house of his silver and gold?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you!\u2019 cried Tom. \u2018What noise was that?\u2019 said the thief, frightened; \u2018I\u2019m sure I heard someone speak.\u2019 They stood still listening, and Tom said, \u2018Take me with you, and I\u2019ll soon show you how to get the parson\u2019s money.\u2019 \u2018But where are you?\u2019 said they. \u2018Look about on the ground,\u2019 answered he, \u2018and listen where the sound comes from.\u2019 At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him up in their hands. \u2018You little urchin!\u2019 they said, \u2018what can you do for us?\u2019 \u2018Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson\u2019s house, and throw you out whatever you want.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a good thought,\u2019 said the thieves; \u2018come along, we shall see what you can do.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the parson\u2019s house, Tom slipped through the window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl, \u2018Will you have all that is here?\u2019 At this the thieves were frightened, and said, \u2018Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.\u2019 But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again, \u2018How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?\u2019 Now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, \u2018The little urchin is only trying to make fools of us.\u2019 So they came back and whispered softly to him, saying, \u2018Now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.\u2019 Then Tom called out as loud as he could, \u2018Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light. By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open.\r\n\r\nThe little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug place to finish his night\u2019s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow\u2019s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. \u2018Good lack-a-day!\u2019 said he, \u2018how came I to tumble into the mill?\u2019 But he soon found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between the cow\u2019s teeth, and so be crushed to death. At last down he went into her stomach. \u2018It is rather dark,\u2019 said he; \u2018they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.\u2019\r\n\r\nThough he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he cried out as loud as he could, \u2018Don\u2019t bring me any more hay! Don\u2019t bring me any more hay!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the parson, and said, \u2018Sir, sir, the cow is talking!\u2019 But the parson said, \u2018Woman, thou art surely mad!\u2019 However, he went with her into the cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, \u2018Don\u2019t bring me any more hay!\u2019 Then the parson himself was frightened; and thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\r\n\r\nTom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\r\n\r\nTom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called out, \u2018My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.\u2019 \u2018Where\u2019s that?\u2019 said the wolf. \u2018In such and such a house,\u2019 said Tom, describing his own father\u2019s house. \u2018You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can wish.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart\u2019s content. As soon as he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that he could not go out by the same way he came in.\r\n\r\nThis was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a great shout, making all the noise he could. \u2018Will you be easy?\u2019 said the wolf; \u2018you\u2019ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s that to me?\u2019 said the little man; \u2018you have had your frolic, now I\u2019ve a mind to be merry myself\u2019; and he began, singing and shouting as loud as he could.\r\n\r\nThe woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe. \u2018Do you stay behind,\u2019 said the woodman, \u2018and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the scythe.\u2019 Tom heard all this, and cried out, \u2018Father, father! I am here, the wolf has swallowed me.\u2019 And his father said, \u2018Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again\u2019; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the father, \u2018what fears we have had for you!\u2019 \u2018Yes, father,\u2019 answered he; \u2018I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.\u2019 \u2018Why, where have you been?\u2019 said his father. \u2018I have been in a mouse-hole\u2014and in a snail-shell\u2014and down a cow\u2019s throat\u2014and in the wolf\u2019s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said they, \u2018you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey. So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always agreed that, after all, there\u2019s no place like HOME!\r\nRUMPELSTILTSKIN\r\n\r\nBy the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller\u2019s house was close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter. She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller\u2019s boast his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, \u2018All this must be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.\u2019 It was in vain that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father, for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber door was locked, and she was left alone.\r\n\r\nShe sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled in, and said, \u2018Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you weeping for?\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she, \u2018I must spin this straw into gold, and I know not how.\u2019 \u2018What will you give me,\u2019 said the hobgoblin, \u2018to do it for you?\u2019 \u2018My necklace,\u2019 replied the maiden. He took her at her word, and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\r\n\r\n \u2018Round about, round about,\r\n    Lo and behold!\r\n  Reel away, reel away,\r\n    Straw into gold!\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and the straw was all spun into gold.\r\n\r\nWhen the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased; but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor miller\u2019s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do, and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and said, \u2018What will you give me to do your task?\u2019 \u2018The ring on my finger,\u2019 said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the wheel again, and whistled and sang:\r\n\r\n \u2018Round about, round about,\r\n    Lo and behold!\r\n  Reel away, reel away,\r\n    Straw into gold!\u2019\r\n\r\ntill, long before morning, all was done again.\r\n\r\nThe king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure; but still he had not enough: so he took the miller\u2019s daughter to a yet larger heap, and said, \u2018All this must be spun tonight; and if it is, you shall be my queen.\u2019 As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and said, \u2018What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?\u2019 \u2018I have nothing left,\u2019 said she. \u2018Then say you will give me,\u2019 said the little man, \u2018the first little child that you may have when you are queen.\u2019 \u2018That may never be,\u2019 thought the miller\u2019s daughter: and as she knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller\u2019s daughter, and she really became queen.\r\n\r\nAt the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at last her tears softened him, and he said, \u2018I will give you three days\u2019 grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your child.\u2019\r\n\r\nNow the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could remember; but to all and each of them he said, \u2018Madam, that is not my name.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of, BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman still said to every one of them, \u2018Madam, that is not my name.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe third day one of the messengers came back, and said, \u2018I have travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing:\r\n\r\n  \u201cMerrily the feast I\u2019ll make.\r\n  Today I\u2019ll brew, tomorrow bake;\r\n  Merrily I\u2019ll dance and sing,\r\n  For next day will a stranger bring.\r\n  Little does my lady dream\r\n  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!\u201d\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, \u2018Now, lady, what is my name?\u2019 \u2018Is it JOHN?\u2019 asked she. \u2018No, madam!\u2019 \u2018Is it TOM?\u2019 \u2018No, madam!\u2019 \u2018Is it JEMMY?\u2019 \u2018It is not.\u2019 \u2018Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?\u2019 said the lady slyly. \u2018Some witch told you that!\u2014some witch told you that!\u2019 cried the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it out.\r\n\r\nThen he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much trouble for nothing, and said, \u2018We wish you a very good morning, and a merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!\u2019\r\nCLEVER GRETEL\r\n\r\nThere was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: \u2018You certainly are a pretty girl!\u2019 And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: \u2018The cook must know what the food is like.\u2019\r\n\r\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her: \u2018Gretel, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.\u2019 \u2018I will see to it, master,\u2019 answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out to her master: \u2018If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest.\u2019 The master said: \u2018I will run myself, and fetch the guest.\u2019 When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: \u2018Standing so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.\u2019 She ran down, set a jug, said: \u2018God bless it for you, Gretel,\u2019 and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.\r\n\r\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good, Gretel thought: \u2018Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!\u2019 She touched it with her finger, and said: \u2018Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!\u2019 She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought: \u2018One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.\u2019 So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: \u2018The other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing.\u2019 When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to her: \u2018Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in somewhere.\u2019 Then she said: \u2018Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God\u2019s good gifts be spoilt?\u2019 So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said: \u2018What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what\u2019s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm.\u2019 So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\r\n\r\nWhile she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: \u2018Hurry up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir, I will soon serve up,\u2019 answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door. Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and said: \u2018Hush! hush! go away as quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!\u2019 The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: \u2018You have invited a fine guest!\u2019 \u2018Why, Gretel? What do you mean by that?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a nice trick!\u2019 said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. \u2018If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.\u2019 He called to him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying: \u2018Just one, just one,\u2019 meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him.\r\nTHE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\r\n\r\nThere was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth. His son and his son\u2019s wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence, out of which he had to eat.\r\n\r\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. \u2018What are you doing there?\u2019 asked the father. \u2018I am making a little trough,\u2019 answered the child, \u2018for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything.\r\nTHE LITTLE PEASANT\r\n\r\nThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her: \u2018Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.\u2019 the woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.\r\n\r\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd in and said: \u2018Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has to be carried.\u2019 The cow-herd said: \u2018All right,\u2019 and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said: \u2018It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already!\u2019 At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: \u2018If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don\u2019t care to drag you home again in my arms.\u2019 But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The cow-herd answered: \u2018It is still standing out there eating. It would not stop and come with us.\u2019 But the little peasant said: \u2018Oh, but I must have my beast back again.\u2019 Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: \u2018It must have run away.\u2019 The peasant, however, said: \u2018Don\u2019t tell me that,\u2019 and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\r\n\r\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller\u2019s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: \u2018Lay yourself on the straw there,\u2019 and gave him a slice of bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: \u2018He is tired and has gone to sleep.\u2019 In the meantime came the parson; the miller\u2019s wife received him well, and said: \u2018My husband is out, so we will have a feast.\u2019 The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\r\n\r\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. The woman said: \u2018Oh, heavens! It is my husband!\u2019 she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: \u2018Thank heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end.\u2019 The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, \u2018What is that fellow doing there?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the wife, \u2018the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.\u2019 The man said: \u2018I have no objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.\u2019 The woman said: \u2018But I have nothing but bread and cheese.\u2019 \u2018I am contented with anything,\u2019 replied the husband, \u2018so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,\u2019 and looked at the peasant and said: \u2018Come and eat some more with me.\u2019 The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: \u2018What have you there?\u2019 The peasant answered: \u2018I have a soothsayer inside it.\u2019 \u2018Can he foretell anything to me?\u2019 said the miller. \u2018Why not?\u2019 answered the peasant: \u2018but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself.\u2019 The miller was curious, and said: \u2018Let him foretell something for once.\u2019 Then the peasant pinched the raven\u2019s head, so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: \u2018What did he say?\u2019 The peasant answered: \u2018In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow.\u2019 \u2018Bless me!\u2019 cried the miller, and went there and found the wine. \u2018Now go on,\u2019 said he. The peasant made the raven croak again, and said: \u2018In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.\u2019 \u2018Upon my word!\u2019 cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said: \u2018Thirdly, he says that there is some salad on the bed.\u2019 \u2018That would be a fine thing!\u2019 cried the miller, and went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked, and said: \u2018Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes under the bed.\u2019 \u2018That would be a fine thing!\u2019 cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\r\n\r\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller\u2019s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant said: \u2018First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is something bad.\u2019 So they ate, and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven\u2019s head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: \u2018What did he say?\u2019 The peasant replied: \u2018He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch.\u2019 The miller said: \u2018The Devil must go out,\u2019 and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said: \u2018It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes.\u2019 The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers.\r\n\r\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house, and the peasants said: \u2018The small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.\u2019 Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: \u2018I sold my cow\u2019s skin in the town, for three hundred talers.\u2019 When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: \u2018But my servant must go first.\u2019 When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said: \u2018What can I do with all these skins?\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller\u2019s wife. He said to him: \u2018I set you free from the closet, set me free from the barrel.\u2019 At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: \u2018No, I will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!\u2019 The shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: \u2018What are you about? What is it that you will not do?\u2019 The peasant said: \u2018They want to make me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.\u2019 The shepherd said: \u2018If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.\u2019 The peasant said: \u2018If you will get in, you will be mayor.\u2019 The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd\u2019s flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried: \u2018I am quite willing to be mayor.\u2019 They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: \u2018That is what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below there,\u2019 and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\r\n\r\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said: \u2018Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the water?\u2019 \u2018Yes, truly,\u2019 replied the peasant, \u2018I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with me.\u2019 Said the peasants: \u2018Are there any more there?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, \u2018more than I could want.\u2019 Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: \u2018I come first.\u2019 So they went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried: \u2018We already see the sheep down below!\u2019 The mayor pressed forward and said: \u2018I will go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I\u2019ll call you.\u2019 So he jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\r\nFREDERICK AND CATHERINE\r\n\r\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said. \u2018Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 said she, \u2018it shall all be ready.\u2019 When dinner-time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself, \u2018The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the cellar for the ale.\u2019 So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her head, \u2018The dog is not shut up\u2014he may be running away with the steak; that\u2019s well thought of.\u2019 So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it.\r\n\r\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. \u2018It\u2019s all gone, and \u201cwhat can\u2019t be cured must be endured\u201d,\u2019 said Catherine. So she turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool herself.\r\n\r\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened. \u2018My stars!\u2019 said she, \u2018what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?\u2019 So she thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely. \u2018What a lucky thing,\u2019 said she, \u2018that we kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.\u2019 So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. \u2018Ah! well,\u2019 said she, \u2018when one goes another may as well follow.\u2019 Then she strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, \u2018How very neat and clean it looks!\u2019\r\n\r\nAt noon Frederick came home. \u2018Now, wife,\u2019 cried he, \u2018what have you for dinner?\u2019 \u2018O Frederick!\u2019 answered she, \u2018I was cooking you a steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!\u2019 \u2018Kate, Kate,\u2019 said he, \u2018how could you do all this?\u2019 Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?\u2019 \u2018Why, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe husband thought to himself, \u2018If my wife manages matters thus, I must look sharp myself.\u2019 Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he said to Catherine, \u2018What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them.\u2019 \u2018No, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018that I never will.\u2019 As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. \u2018Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.\u2019 \u2018Yellow buttons!\u2019 said they: \u2018let us have a look at them.\u2019 \u2018Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.\u2019 So the rogues went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out, \u2018Kate, what have you been doing?\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018I have bought all these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019 said Frederick, \u2018what a pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you to do such a thing?\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 answered she, \u2018I did not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.\u2019\r\n\r\nCatherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, \u2018Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the thieves.\u2019 \u2018Well, we will try,\u2019 answered he; \u2018but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the fastest, he left his wife some way behind. \u2018It does not matter,\u2019 thought she: \u2018when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.\u2019\r\n\r\nPresently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed. \u2018Ah, see now,\u2019 said she, \u2018how they have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.\u2019 So she took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, \u2018Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than I have.\u2019 Then she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting for them.\r\n\r\nAt last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. \u2018Where are the butter and cheese?\u2019 said he. \u2018Oh!\u2019 answered she, \u2018I used the butter to grease those poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on the road together somewhere.\u2019 \u2018What a goose you are to do such silly things!\u2019 said the husband. \u2018How can you say so?\u2019 said she; \u2018I am sure you never told me not.\u2019\r\n\r\nThey ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, \u2018Kate, I hope you locked the door safe when you came away.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered she, \u2018you did not tell me.\u2019 \u2018Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,\u2019 said Frederick, \u2018and bring with you something to eat.\u2019\r\n\r\nCatherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way, \u2018Frederick wants something to eat; but I don\u2019t think he is very fond of butter and cheese: I\u2019ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for I have often seen him take some.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, \u2018Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.\u2019 So she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, \u2018There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you please.\u2019 \u2018Alas! alas!\u2019 said he, \u2018what a clever wife I have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so that everybody may go in and out as they please\u2014however, as you have brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 answered she, \u2018I\u2019ll carry the door; but I\u2019ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also\u2014that would be too much of a load; so if you please, I\u2019ll fasten them to the door.\u2019\r\n\r\nFrederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there. Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said, \u2018It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.\u2019\r\n\r\nCatherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said softly, \u2018Frederick, I must let the nuts go.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered he, \u2018not now, they will discover us.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help that: they must go.\u2019 \u2018Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.\u2019 Then away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, \u2018Bless me, it is hailing.\u2019\r\n\r\nA little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so she whispered to Frederick, \u2018I must throw the vinegar down.\u2019 \u2018Pray don\u2019t,\u2019 answered he, \u2018it will discover us.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said she, \u2018go it must.\u2019 So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said, \u2018What a heavy dew there is!\u2019\r\n\r\nAt last it popped into Catherine\u2019s head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, \u2018Frederick, I must throw the door down soon.\u2019 But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he was sure it would betray them. \u2018Here goes, however,\u2019 said she: and down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried out \u2018Murder!\u2019 and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound.\r\nSWEETHEART ROLAND\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated, because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and told her mother that she must and would have that apron. \u2018Be quiet, my child,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018and you shall have it. Your stepsister has long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and push her well to the front.\u2019 It would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, the witch\u2019s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child\u2019s head off.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said to him: \u2018Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said Roland, \u2018I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us.\u2019 The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the dead girl\u2019s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she hurried away with her lover.\r\n\r\nWhen the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch cried: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,\u2019 answered the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the stairs, and cried again: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Here in the kitchen, I am warming myself,\u2019 cried the second drop of blood. She went into the kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Ah, here in the bed, I am sleeping,\u2019 cried the third drop of blood. She went into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child, whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland. \u2018That shall not help you,\u2019 cried she, \u2018even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.\u2019 She put on her many-league boots, in which she covered an hour\u2019s walk at every step, and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore, threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up towards them, and said to the musician: \u2018Dear musician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I will play to you while you do it.\u2019 As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\r\n\r\nAs they were now set free, Roland said: \u2018Now I will go to my father and arrange for the wedding.\u2019 \u2018Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait for you,\u2019 said the girl, \u2018and that no one may recognize me, I will change myself into a red stone landmark.\u2019 Then Roland went away, and the girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved. But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought: \u2018Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down.\u2019\r\n\r\nIt befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened in the shepherd\u2019s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said: \u2018There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned, he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him, who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this time she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story, and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she answered: \u2018No,\u2019 for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\r\n\r\nAnd now the time drew near when Roland\u2019s wedding was to be celebrated, and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither, but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland\u2019s ears, he sprang up and cried: \u2018I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!\u2019 Everything he had forgotten, and which had vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and joy began.\r\nSNOWDROP\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, \u2018Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as black as this ebony windowframe!\u2019 And so the little girl really did grow up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\r\n\r\nBut this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon herself in it, and say:\r\n\r\n \u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd the glass had always answered:\r\n\r\n \u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself. Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it as usual:\r\n\r\n \u2018Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\r\n  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, \u2018Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more.\u2019 Then the servant led her away; but his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he said, \u2018I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.\u2019 So he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\r\n\r\nThen poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nBy and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold. They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not right. The first said, \u2018Who has been sitting on my stool?\u2019 The second, \u2018Who has been eating off my plate?\u2019 The third, \u2018Who has been picking my bread?\u2019 The fourth, \u2018Who has been meddling with my spoon?\u2019 The fifth, \u2018Who has been handling my fork?\u2019 The sixth, \u2018Who has been cutting with my knife?\u2019 The seventh, \u2018Who has been drinking my wine?\u2019 Then the first looked round and said, \u2018Who has been lying on my bed?\u2019 And the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, \u2018Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!\u2019 And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at home; and they warned her, and said, \u2018The queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd the glass answered:\r\n\r\n \u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her. And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she knocked at the door, and cried, \u2018Fine wares to sell!\u2019 Snowdrop looked out at the window, and said, \u2018Good day, good woman! what have you to sell?\u2019 \u2018Good wares, fine wares,\u2019 said she; \u2018laces and bobbins of all colours.\u2019 \u2018I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of body,\u2019 thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door. \u2018Bless me!\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018how badly your stays are laced! Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.\u2019 Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop\u2019s breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. \u2018There\u2019s an end to all thy beauty,\u2019 said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, \u2018The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb. When she reached the dwarfs\u2019 cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, \u2018Fine wares to sell!\u2019 But Snowdrop said, \u2018I dare not let anyone in.\u2019 Then the queen said, \u2018Only look at my beautiful combs!\u2019 and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. \u2018There you may lie,\u2019 said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone.\r\n\r\nMeantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said, \u2018Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.\u2019 So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant\u2019s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs\u2019 cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, \u2018I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.\u2019 \u2018Do as you please,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Snowdrop, \u2018I dare not take it.\u2019 \u2018You silly girl!\u2019 answered the other, \u2018what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.\u2019 Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. \u2018This time nothing will save thee,\u2019 said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.\r\n\r\nWhen evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, \u2018We will never bury her in the cold ground.\u2019 And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king\u2019s daughter. And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\r\n\r\nAnd thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs\u2019 house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, \u2018We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.\u2019 At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, \u2018Where am I?\u2019 And the prince said, \u2018Thou art quite safe with me.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen he told her all that had happened, and said, \u2018I love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father\u2019s palace, and you shall be my wife.\u2019 And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.\r\n\r\nTo the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop\u2019s old enemy the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd the glass answered:\r\n\r\n \u2018Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\r\n  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need.\r\nTHE PINK\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children. Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her and said: \u2018Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.\u2019 Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\r\n\r\nEvery morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen\u2019s apron and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over.\r\n\r\nThe cook, however, thought to himself: \u2018If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.\u2019 So he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to speak, and said to him: \u2018Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with a garden, and all else that pertains to it.\u2019 Scarcely were the words out of the boy\u2019s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for. After a while the cook said to him: \u2018It is not well for you to be so alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.\u2019 Then the king\u2019s son wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however, that the king\u2019s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: \u2018Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.\u2019 Thereupon he went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and said: \u2018Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?\u2019 The cook once more said: \u2018If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.\u2019 When he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: \u2018Lie down in your bed, and draw the clothes over you.\u2019 Then the wicked wretch came in and said: \u2018Where are the boy\u2019s heart and tongue?\u2019 The girl reached the plate to him, but the king\u2019s son threw off the quilt, and said: \u2018You old sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence. You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your throat.\u2019 And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from his throat. The king\u2019s son remained there a short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still alive. At length he said to the maiden: \u2018I will go home to my own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 she replied, \u2018the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown?\u2019 As she did not seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and looked inside, and cried: \u2018Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still alive, or are you dead?\u2019 She answered: \u2018I have just eaten, and am still satisfied,\u2019 for she thought the angels were there. Said he: \u2018I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.\u2019 Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him. And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them. Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had none at all for years.\r\n\r\nNow the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: \u2018As you are so clever, you shall sit by me.\u2019 He replied: \u2018Lord King, your majesty must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.\u2019 But the king insisted on it, and said: \u2018You shall sit by me,\u2019 until he did it. Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king\u2019s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began, and said: \u2018Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?\u2019 But the king replied: \u2018She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.\u2019 Then the huntsman arose and said: \u2018Gracious lord father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken.\u2019 Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said: \u2018That is the wretch!\u2019 and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke further and said: \u2018Father, will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it, though her own life depended on it?\u2019 The king replied: \u2018Yes, I would like to see her.\u2019 The son said: \u2018Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,\u2019 and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it. Then the son said: \u2018Now will I show her to you in her own form,\u2019 and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\r\n\r\nAnd the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower, to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was led in she ate nothing, and said: \u2018The gracious and merciful God who has supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.\u2019 She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king\u2019s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God.\r\nCLEVER ELSIE\r\n\r\nThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And when she had grown up her father said: \u2018We will get her married.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018if only someone would come who would have her.\u2019 At length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans; but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the father, \u2018she has plenty of good sense\u2019; and the mother said: \u2018Oh, she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Hans, \u2018if she is not really smart, I won\u2019t have her.\u2019 When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: \u2018Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.\u2019 Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left there.\r\n\r\nThen Clever Elsie began to weep and said: \u2018If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\u2019 Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink, but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant: \u2018Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.\u2019 The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. \u2018Elsie why do you weep?\u2019 asked the maid. \u2018Ah,\u2019 she answered, \u2018have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him.\u2019 Then said the maid: \u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\u2019 and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while, as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy: \u2018Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie and the girl are.\u2019 The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: \u2018Why are you weeping?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Elsie, \u2018have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\u2019 Then said the boy: \u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\u2019 and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman: \u2018Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is!\u2019 The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the mother likewise: \u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\u2019 and sat down and wept with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: \u2018I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.\u2019 But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie\u2019s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: \u2018Oh, what a clever Elsie!\u2019 and sat down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: \u2018They must be waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.\u2019 When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each out-doing the other. \u2018What misfortune has happened then?\u2019 asked he. \u2018Ah, dear Hans,\u2019 said Elsie, \u2018if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?\u2019 \u2018Come,\u2019 said Hans, \u2018more understanding than that is not needed for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,\u2019 and seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\r\n\r\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said: \u2018Wife, I am going out to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.\u2019 \u2018Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.\u2019 After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: \u2018What shall I do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.\u2019 Then she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said: \u2018What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first? I will sleep first.\u2019 Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep. Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said he: \u2018What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.\u2019 But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler\u2019s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said: \u2018Is it I, or is it not I?\u2019 But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought: \u2018I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know.\u2019 She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried: \u2018Hans, is Elsie within?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered Hans, \u2018she is within.\u2019 Hereupon she was terrified, and said: \u2018Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,\u2019 and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has seen her since.\r\nTHE MISER IN THE BUSH\r\n\r\nA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came into the man\u2019s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, \u2018I have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.\u2019 The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year\u2019s service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself, \u2018Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.\u2019 With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley.\r\n\r\nAs he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry. \u2018Why, what should make me down-hearted?\u2019 said he; \u2018I am sound in health and rich in purse, what should I care for? I have saved up my three years\u2019 earnings and have it all safe in my pocket.\u2019 \u2018How much may it come to?\u2019 said the little man. \u2018Full threepence,\u2019 replied the countryman. \u2018I wish you would give them to me,\u2019 said the other; \u2018I am very poor.\u2019 Then the man pitied him, and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, \u2018As you have such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes\u2014one for every penny; so choose whatever you like.\u2019 Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, \u2018I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.\u2019 The dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way.\r\n\r\nOur honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing away most joyfully. \u2018Oh, what a pretty bird!\u2019 said the miser; \u2018I would give a great deal of money to have such a one.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s all,\u2019 said the countryman, \u2018I will soon bring it down.\u2019 Then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. \u2018Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake!\u2019 cried the miser, \u2018Master! master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?\u2019 \u2018Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,\u2019 said the other; \u2018thou art only meeting thy reward\u2019: so he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician\u2019s price for some time, and he danced him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman saw so much money, he said, \u2018I will agree to your proposal.\u2019 So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried.\r\n\r\nThe miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money. \u2018No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.\u2019 said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\r\n\r\nSo away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, \u2018My Lord Judge, grant me one last request.\u2019 \u2018Anything but thy life,\u2019 replied the other. \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my fiddle for the last time.\u2019 The miser cried out, \u2018Oh, no! no! for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t listen to him! don\u2019t listen to him!\u2019 But the judge said, \u2018It is only this once, he will soon have done.\u2019 The fact was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf\u2019s third gift.\r\n\r\nThen the miser said, \u2018Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity\u2019s sake.\u2019 But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together\u2014judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred florins.\r\n\r\nThen he called to the miser, and said, \u2018Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,\u2019 \u2018I stole it,\u2019 said the miser in the presence of all the people; \u2018I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.\u2019 Then the countryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\r\nASHPUTTEL\r\n\r\nThe wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, \u2018Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.\u2019 Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her; they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl. \u2018What does the good-for-nothing want in the parlour?\u2019 said they; \u2018they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen-maid!\u2019 Then they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThere she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\r\n\r\nIt happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his wife\u2019s daughters what he should bring them. \u2018Fine clothes,\u2019 said the first; \u2018Pearls and diamonds,\u2019 cried the second. \u2018Now, child,\u2019 said he to his own daughter, \u2018what will you have?\u2019 \u2018The first twig, dear father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come homewards,\u2019 said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to her mother\u2019s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself. Ashputtel\u2019s two sisters were asked to come; so they called her up, and said, \u2018Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king\u2019s feast.\u2019 Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go. \u2018You, Ashputtel!\u2019 said she; \u2018you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance\u2014you want to go to the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of her, \u2018I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in two hours\u2019 time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast too.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\r\n\r\n \u2018Hither, hither, through the sky,\r\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\r\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\r\n  One and all come help me, quick!\r\n  Haste ye, haste ye!\u2014pick, pick, pick!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes. And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite done, and all flew out again at the windows.\r\n\r\nThen Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, \u2018No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.\u2019 And when Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, \u2018If you can in one hour\u2019s time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go too.\u2019 And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\r\n\r\nBut the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried out as before:\r\n\r\n \u2018Hither, hither, through the sky,\r\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\r\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\r\n  One and all come help me, quick!\r\n  Haste ye, haste ye!\u2014pick, pick, pick!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour\u2019s time all was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball. But her mother said, \u2018It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame\u2019: and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.\r\n\r\nNow when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\r\n\r\n \u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her, and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel, taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\r\n\r\nThe king\u2019s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, \u2018This lady is dancing with me.\u2019\r\n\r\nThus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to go home: and the king\u2019s son said, \u2018I shall go and take care of you to your home\u2019; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her little grey frock.\r\n\r\nThe next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone wondered at her beauty: but the king\u2019s son, who was waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to dance, he said as before, \u2018This lady is dancing with me.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king\u2019s son followed here as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang away from him all at once into the garden behind her father\u2019s house. In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen. Then the king\u2019s son lost sight of her, and could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, \u2018The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.\u2019 The father thought to himself, \u2018Can it be Ashputtel?\u2019 So he had an axe brought; and they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey frock.\r\n\r\nThe third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she went again into the garden, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the king\u2019s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to dance, he said, \u2018This lady is my partner, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king\u2019s son would go with her, and said to himself, \u2018I will not lose her this time\u2019; but, however, she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father, and said, \u2018I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper fits.\u2019 Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, \u2018Never mind, cut it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.\u2019 So the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe, and went to the king\u2019s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\r\n\r\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\r\n\r\n \u2018Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\r\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\r\n  For she\u2019s not the true one that sits by thy side.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home, and said, \u2018This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper.\u2019 Then she went into the room and got her foot into the shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king\u2019s son: and he set her as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\r\n\r\nBut when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still, and sang:\r\n\r\n \u2018Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\r\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\r\n  For she\u2019s not the true one that sits by thy side.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse and brought her also back again. \u2018This is not the true bride,\u2019 said he to the father; \u2018have you no other daughters?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said he; \u2018there is only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride.\u2019 The prince told him to send her. But the mother said, \u2018No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show herself.\u2019 However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot, and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, \u2018This is the right bride.\u2019 But the mother and both the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang:\r\n\r\n \u2018Home! home! look at the shoe!\r\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\r\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon her right shoulder, and so went home with her.\r\nTHE WHITE SNAKE\r\n\r\nA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\r\n\r\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was dismissed with no better answer.\r\n\r\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened. They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: \u2018Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen\u2019s window.\u2019 The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook: \u2018Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; \u2018she has spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long enough.\u2019 So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen\u2019s ring was found inside her.\r\n\r\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: \u2018We will remember you and repay you for saving us!\u2019\r\n\r\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: \u2018Why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without mercy!\u2019 So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to him: \u2018We will remember you\u2014one good turn deserves another!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. \u2018Out with you, you idle, good-for-nothing creatures!\u2019 cried they; \u2018we cannot find food for you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.\u2019 But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and crying: \u2018Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves, and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?\u2019 So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: \u2018We will remember you\u2014one good turn deserves another!\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: \u2018The king\u2019s daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.\u2019 Many had already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king\u2019s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\r\n\r\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea, and added: \u2018If you come up again without it you will be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.\u2019 All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea.\r\n\r\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth\u2019s feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell. Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward.\r\n\r\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: \u2018Tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be wanting.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death. But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\r\n\r\nPresently the king\u2019s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him. But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: \u2018Although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.\u2019 The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever, as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and said: \u2018We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life stands, and have brought you the apple.\u2019 The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king\u2019s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\r\nTHE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said: \u2018Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you all\u2014skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.\u2019 The kids said: \u2018Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety.\u2019 Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: \u2018Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.\u2019 But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice. \u2018We will not open the door,\u2019 cried they, \u2018you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!\u2019 Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called: \u2018Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.\u2019 But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried: \u2018We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!\u2019 Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: \u2018I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.\u2019 And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: \u2018Strew some white meal over my feet for me.\u2019 The miller thought to himself: \u2018The wolf wants to deceive someone,\u2019 and refused; but the wolf said: \u2018If you will not do it, I will devour you.\u2019 Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.\r\n\r\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said: \u2018Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.\u2019 The little kids cried: \u2018First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.\u2019 Then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice cried: \u2018Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.\u2019 She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\r\n\r\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her. When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. \u2018Ah, heavens,\u2019 she said, \u2018is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?\u2019 Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut open the monster\u2019s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: \u2018Now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast\u2019s stomach with them while he is still asleep.\u2019 Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried he:\r\n\r\n \u2018What rumbles and tumbles\r\n  Against my poor bones?\r\n  I thought \u2018twas six kids,\r\n  But it feels like big stones.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: \u2018The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead!\u2019 and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.\r\nTHE QUEEN BEE\r\n\r\nTwo kings\u2019 sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the little dwarf said, \u2018Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not suffer you to trouble them.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the dwarf said, \u2018Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill them.\u2019 Next they came to a bees\u2019-nest in a hollow tree, and there was so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey. But the dwarf held them back, and said, \u2018Let the pretty insects enjoy themselves, I cannot let you burn them.\u2019\r\n\r\nAt length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then he rose and came out to them.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table, where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: \u2018In the wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king\u2019s daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun, he who seeks them will be turned into marble.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day: but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\r\n\r\nThe next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\r\n\r\nAt last came the little dwarf\u2019s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!\u2014so he sat down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a heap.\r\n\r\nThe second tablet said: \u2018The key of the princess\u2019s bed-chamber must be fished up out of the lake.\u2019 And as the dwarf came to the brink of it, he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and the best of the king\u2019s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey; so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\r\n\r\nThen came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after her father\u2019s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.\r\nTHE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\r\n\r\nThere was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes.\r\n\r\nThen he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening. He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more. In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and the good man soon became thriving and well off again.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over the fire chatting together, he said to her, \u2018I should like to sit up and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for me.\u2019 The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up there, and watched what would happen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker\u2019s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table. This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as lightning.\r\n\r\nThe next day the wife said to the shoemaker. \u2018These little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold. I\u2019ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted.\r\n\r\nThen they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door, and away over the green.\r\n\r\nThe good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived.\r\nTHE JUNIPER-TREE\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they remained childless.\r\n\r\nIn front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree. One winter\u2019s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the snow. \u2018Ah,\u2019 sighed the woman heavily, \u2018if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow,\u2019 and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed, and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all the earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. \u2018If I die, bury me under the juniper-tree.\u2019 Then she felt comforted and happy again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy was so great that she died.\r\n\r\nHer husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he married again.\r\n\r\nHe now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left school to the time he went back.\r\n\r\nOne day the little daughter came running to her mother in the store-room, and said, \u2018Mother, give me an apple.\u2019 \u2018Yes, my child,\u2019 said the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.\r\n\r\n\u2018Mother,\u2019 said the little daughter again, \u2018may not brother have one too?\u2019 The mother was angry at this, but she answered, \u2018Yes, when he comes out of school.\u2019\r\n\r\nJust then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out of her little daughter\u2019s hand, and said, \u2018You shall not have one before your brother.\u2019 She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to him, \u2018My son, will you have an apple?\u2019 but she gave him a wicked look. \u2018Mother,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018how dreadful you look! Yes, give me an apple.\u2019 The thought came to her that she would kill him. \u2018Come with me,\u2019 she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; \u2018take one out for yourself.\u2019 And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy\u2019s head. Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done. \u2018If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,\u2019 she thought. So she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy\u2019s head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, \u2018Mother, brother is sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale; and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that frightened me.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Go to him again,\u2019 said her mother, \u2018and if he does not answer, give him a box on the ear.\u2019 So little Marleen went, and said, \u2018Brother, give me that apple,\u2019 but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran crying and screaming to her mother. \u2018Oh!\u2019 she said, \u2018I have knocked off brother\u2019s head,\u2019 and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\r\n\r\n\u2018What have you done!\u2019 said her mother, \u2018but no one must know about it, so you must keep silence; what is done can\u2019t be undone; we will make him into puddings.\u2019 And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt.\r\n\r\nPresently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked, \u2018Where is my son?\u2019 The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\r\n\r\nThe father again asked, \u2018Where is my son?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 answered the wife, \u2018he is gone into the country to his mother\u2019s great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six weeks; he is well looked after there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018I feel very unhappy about it,\u2019 said the husband, \u2018in case it should not be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.\u2019\r\n\r\nWith this he went on with his dinner, and said, \u2018Little Marleen, why do you weep? Brother will soon be back.\u2019 Then he asked his wife for more pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\r\n\r\nLittle Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her, and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.\r\n\r\nLittle Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate.\r\n\r\nThe bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to sing:\r\n\r\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\r\n\r\n\u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Nay,\u2019 said the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold chain, and I will sing it you again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Here is the chain, take it,\u2019 said the goldsmith. \u2018Only sing me that again.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\r\n\r\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker\u2019s house and sang:\r\n\r\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\r\n\r\n\u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018how beautifully you sing!\u2019 Then he called through the door to his wife: \u2018Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it and hear how beautifully it sings.\u2019 Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head.\r\n\r\n\u2018Bird,\u2019 said the shoemaker, \u2018sing me that song again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Nay,\u2019 answered the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing; you must give me something.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Wife,\u2019 said the man, \u2018go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.\u2019 The wife went in and fetched the shoes.\r\n\r\n\u2018There, bird,\u2019 said the shoemaker, \u2018now sing me that song again.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he went back to the roof and sang:\r\n\r\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the mill went \u2018Click clack, click clack, click clack.\u2019 Inside the mill were twenty of the miller\u2019s men hewing a stone, and as they went \u2018Hick hack, hick hack, hick hack,\u2019 the mill went \u2018Click clack, click clack, click clack.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\r\n\r\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\nthen one of the men left off,\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\ntwo more men left off and listened,\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\nthen four more left off,\r\n\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n\r\nNow there were only eight at work,\r\n\r\n  Underneath,\r\n\r\nand now only five,\r\n\r\n  the juniper-tree.\r\n\r\nand now only one,\r\n\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\r\n\r\nthen he looked up and the last one had left off work.\r\n\r\n\u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it too; sing it again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Nay,\u2019 answered the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that millstone, and I will sing it again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018If it belonged to me alone,\u2019 said the man, \u2018you should have it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 said the others: \u2018if he will sing again, he can have it.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the tree and sang\u2014\r\n\r\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round his neck, he flew right away to his father\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nThe father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\r\n\r\n\u2018How lighthearted I feel,\u2019 said the father, \u2018so pleased and cheerful.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018And I,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm were coming.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\r\n\r\nThen the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\r\n\r\n\u2018I do feel so happy,\u2019 said the father, \u2018and how beautifully the sun shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said the wife, \u2018and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,\u2019 and she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\r\n\r\nThe bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\r\n\r\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\nthe mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\n\u2018Look, mother,\u2019 said the man, \u2018at the beautiful bird that is singing so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious scent of spice in the air!\u2019\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\nthen little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\r\n\r\n\u2018I must go outside and see the bird nearer,\u2019 said the man.\r\n\r\n\u2018Ah, do not go!\u2019 cried the wife. \u2018I feel as if the whole house were in flames!\u2019\r\n\r\nBut the man went out and looked at the bird.\r\n\r\n She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n And took my bones that they might lie\r\n Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\r\n\r\nWith that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the man\u2019s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\r\n\r\nHe went inside, and said, \u2018See, what a splendid bird that is; he has given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor, and her cap fell from her head.\r\n\r\nThen the bird began again:\r\n\r\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\n\u2018Ah me!\u2019 cried the wife, \u2018if I were but a thousand feet beneath the earth, that I might not hear that song.\u2019\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\nthen the woman fell down again as if dead.\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said little Marleen, \u2018I will go out too and see if the bird will give me anything.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo she went out.\r\n\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n\r\nand he threw down the shoes to her,\r\n\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and danced and jumped about in them. \u2018I was so miserable,\u2019 she said, \u2018when I came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames of fire. \u2018Then I will go out too,\u2019 she said, \u2018and see if it will lighten my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone down on her head, and she was crushed to death.\r\n\r\nThe father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\r\nTHE TURNIP\r\n\r\nThere were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well, and sowed turnips.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, \u2018What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it to the king. \u2018What a wonderful thing!\u2019 said the king; \u2018I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child of fortune.\u2019 \u2018Ah, no!\u2019 answered the gardener, \u2018I am no child of fortune; I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, \u2018You shall be poor no longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.\u2019 Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother\u2019s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\r\n\r\nWhen the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?\r\n\r\nThe king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him. When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother.\r\n\r\nSo he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, \u2018Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us.\u2019 The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\r\n\r\nBut whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out his head.\r\n\r\nWhen the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, \u2018Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!\u2019 The student looked about everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came from, cried out, \u2018Who calls me?\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the man in the tree answered, \u2018Lift up thine eyes, for behold here I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said, \u2018Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to let me into the sack for a little while?\u2019 Then the other answered, as if very unwillingly, \u2018A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give way, and said, \u2018Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.\u2019 So the student let him down, opened the sack, and set him free. \u2018Now then,\u2019 cried he, \u2018let me ascend quickly.\u2019 As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, \u2018Wait a while,\u2019 said the gardener, \u2018that is not the way.\u2019 Then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air. \u2018How is it with thee, friend?\u2019 said he, \u2018dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace, till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo saying, he trotted off on the student\u2019s nag, and left the poor fellow to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.\r\nCLEVER HANS\r\n\r\nThe mother of Hans said: \u2018Whither away, Hans?\u2019 Hans answered: \u2018To Gretel.\u2019 \u2018Behave well, Hans.\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll behave well.

Then Hans goes to his mother. \u2018Good evening, mother.\u2019 \u2018Good evening, Hans.

Then Gretel became angry, tore herself loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.\r\nTHE THREE LANGUAGES\r\n\r\nAn aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: \u2018Hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you.\u2019 The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked: \u2018Now, my son, what have you learnt?\u2019 \u2018Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.\u2019 \u2018Lord have mercy on us!\u2019 cried the father; \u2018is that all you have learnt? I will send you into another town, to another master.\u2019 The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back the father again asked: \u2018My son, what have you learnt?\u2019 He answered: \u2018Father, I have learnt what the birds say.\u2019 Then the father fell into a rage and said: \u2018Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.\u2019 The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired: \u2018My son, what have you learnt?\u2019 he answered: \u2018Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.\u2019 Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: \u2018This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.\u2019 They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.\r\n\r\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night\u2019s lodging. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the lord of the castle, \u2018if you will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given to them, whom they at once devour.\u2019 The whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: \u2018Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.\u2019 As he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle: \u2018The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.\u2019 Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all in his ear.\r\nTHE FOX AND THE CAT\r\n\r\nIt happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself: \u2018He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world,\u2019 she spoke to him in a friendly way. \u2018Good day, dear Mr Fox, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard times?\u2019 The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not. At last he said: \u2018Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How many arts do you understand?\u2019 \u2018I understand but one,\u2019 replied the cat, modestly. \u2018What art is that?\u2019 asked the fox. \u2018When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.\u2019 \u2018Is that all?\u2019 said the fox. \u2018I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from the hounds.\u2019 Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. \u2018Open your sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,\u2019 cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast. \u2018Ah, Mr Fox,\u2019 cried the cat. \u2018You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.\u2019\r\nTHE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS\r\n\r\n\u2018Dear children,\u2019 said a poor man to his four sons, \u2018I have nothing to give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.\u2019 So the four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest said, \u2018Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for himself.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. \u2018I am going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning some art or trade,\u2019 answered he. \u2018Then,\u2019 said the man, \u2018go with me, and I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the other, \u2018that is not an honest calling, and what can one look to earn by it in the end but the gallows?\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said the man, \u2018you need not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care anything about, and where no one can find you out.\u2019 So the young man agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.\r\n\r\nThe second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. \u2018I do not know yet,\u2019 said he. \u2018Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand the stars.\u2019 The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave his master, he gave him a glass, and said, \u2018With this you can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from you.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and said, \u2018Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to do. \u2018Would not you like,\u2019 said he, \u2018to be a tailor?\u2019 \u2018Oh, no!\u2019 said the young man; \u2018sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 answered the man, \u2018that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me, and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.\u2019 Not knowing what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said, \u2018You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.\u2019\r\n\r\nAfter the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other, set off towards their father\u2019s home, where they told him all that had happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high tree, the father said, \u2018I should like to try what each of you can do in this way.\u2019 So he looked up, and said to the second son, \u2018At the top of this tree there is a chaffinch\u2019s nest; tell me how many eggs there are in it.\u2019 The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, \u2018Five.\u2019 \u2018Now,\u2019 said the father to the eldest son, \u2018take away the eggs without letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know anything of what you are doing.\u2019 So the cunning thief climbed up the tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird; and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, \u2018Cut all the eggs in two pieces at one shot.\u2019 The huntsman took up his bow, and at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.\r\n\r\n\u2018Now comes your turn,\u2019 said he to the young tailor; \u2018sew the eggs and the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall have done them no harm.\u2019 Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where the tailor had sewn them together.\r\n\r\n\u2018Well done, sons!\u2019 said the old man; \u2018you have made good use of your time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for you to turn your skill to some account!\u2019\r\n\r\nNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the king\u2019s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four brothers said to each other, \u2018Here is a chance for us; let us try what we can do.\u2019 And they agreed to see whether they could not set the princess free. \u2018I will soon find out where she is, however,\u2019 said the star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, \u2018I see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the dragon close by, guarding her.\u2019 Then he went to the king, and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. \u2018I dare not shoot at him,\u2019 said the huntsman, \u2018for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.\u2019 \u2018Then I will try my skill,\u2019 said the thief, and went and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know it, but went on snoring.\r\n\r\nThen away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe.\r\n\r\nWhen they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, \u2018One of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.\u2019 Then there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, \u2018If I had not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use; therefore she ought to be mine.\u2019 \u2018Your seeing her would have been of no use,\u2019 said the thief, \u2018if I had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought to be mine.\u2019 \u2018No, she is mine,\u2019 said the huntsman; \u2018for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you and the princess into pieces.\u2019 \u2018And if I had not sewn the boat together again,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018you would all have been drowned, therefore she is mine.\u2019 Then the king put in a word, and said, \u2018Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a reward for his skill, half a kingdom.\u2019 So the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.\r\nLILY AND THE LION\r\n\r\nA merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels; but the third, who was called Lily, said, \u2018Dear father, bring me a rose.\u2019 Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all three, and bid them goodbye.\r\n\r\nAnd when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the snow. \u2018A lucky hit!\u2019 said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.\r\n\r\nThis done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce lion, and roared out, \u2018Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive!\u2019 Then the man said, \u2018I knew not that the garden belonged to you; can nothing save my life?\u2019 \u2018No!\u2019 said the lion, \u2018nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your daughter.\u2019 But the man was unwilling to do so and said, \u2018It may be my youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when I go home.\u2019 Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, \u2018It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog.\u2019 And at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return.\r\n\r\nAnd as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest daughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, \u2018Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.\u2019 Then he told her all that had happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.\r\n\r\nBut she comforted him, and said, \u2018Dear father, the word you have given must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let me come safe home again.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself, she knew not whither, till the night came again.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he said to her, \u2018Tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father\u2019s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.\u2019 Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\r\n\r\nHer second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to go to the wedding, she said to the prince, \u2018I will not go alone this time\u2014you must go with me.\u2019 But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but, unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church, and passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her, \u2018Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free.\u2019\r\n\r\nThis said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove. \u2018Now,\u2019 thought she to herself, \u2018no aid of man can be of use to me.\u2019 So she went to the sun and said, \u2018Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill\u2019s top and the valley\u2019s depth\u2014hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the sun, \u2018I have not seen it; but I will give thee a casket\u2014open it when thy hour of need comes.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, \u2018Thou shinest through the night, over field and grove\u2014hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the moon, \u2018I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg\u2014break it when need comes.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it, and said, \u2018Thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf\u2014hast thou not seen my white dove?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the night-wind, \u2018but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen it.\u2019 Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, \u2018I have seen the white dove\u2014he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from you.\u2019 Then the night-wind said, \u2018I will give thee counsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods\u2014count them, and when thou comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you in their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home. I will also give thee this nut,\u2019 continued the night-wind. \u2018When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let you both fall into the sea.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin\u2019s back, and went off carrying the prince away with her.\r\n\r\nThus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, \u2018As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.\u2019 She went on for a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and she heard that the wedding was about to be held. \u2018Heaven aid me now!\u2019 said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be sold. \u2018Not for gold and silver.\u2019 said she, \u2018but for flesh and blood.\u2019 The princess asked what she meant, and she said, \u2018Let me speak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.\u2019 At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: \u2018I have followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?\u2019 But the prince all the time slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\r\n\r\nThen poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one\u2019s wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood. \u2018Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the chamberlain told him all\u2014how he had given him a sleeping draught, and how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife\u2019s voice, and sprang up, and said, \u2018You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea. When they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water, and immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin rested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.\r\nTHE FOX AND THE HORSE\r\n\r\nA farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him nothing more to eat, and said, \u2018I want you no longer, so take yourself off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a lion.\u2019 Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.\r\n\r\nThe poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently a fox met him: \u2018What\u2019s the matter, my friend?\u2019 said he, \u2018why do you hang down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 replied the horse, \u2018justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.\u2019\r\n\r\nHowever, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, \u2018I will help you; lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead.\u2019 The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, \u2018A little way off lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of his carcase.\u2019 The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and when they came to the horse, the fox said, \u2018You will not be able to eat him comfortably here; I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014I will tie you fast to his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your leisure.\u2019\r\n\r\nThis advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the horse on the shoulder, and said, \u2018Jip! Dobbin! Jip!\u2019 Then up he sprang, and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his master\u2019s house.\r\n\r\n\u2018Here he is, master,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have got the better of him\u2019: and when the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. \u2018Thou shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.\u2019 And so the poor old horse had plenty to eat, and lived\u2014till he died.\r\nTHE BLUE LIGHT\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him: \u2018You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.\u2019 Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. \u2018Do give me one night\u2019s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,\u2019 said he to her, \u2018or I shall starve.\u2019 \u2018Oho!\u2019 she answered, \u2018who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.\u2019 \u2018What do you wish?\u2019 said the soldier. \u2018That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.\u2019 The soldier consented, and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. \u2018I see well enough,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018that you can do no more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.\u2019 The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more. \u2018Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.\u2019 Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. \u2018No,\u2019 said he, perceiving her evil intention, \u2018I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.\u2019 The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away.\r\n\r\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. \u2018This shall be my last pleasure,\u2019 thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said: \u2018Lord, what are your commands?\u2019 \u2018What my commands are?\u2019 replied the soldier, quite astonished. \u2018I must do everything you bid me,\u2019 said the little man. \u2018Good,\u2019 said the soldier; \u2018then in the first place help me out of this well.\u2019 The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said to the little man: \u2018Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.\u2019 In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man reappeared. \u2018It is all done,\u2019 said he, \u2018and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?\u2019 inquired the dwarf. \u2018At this moment, none,\u2019 answered the soldier; \u2018you can return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you.\u2019 \u2018Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before you at once.\u2019 Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\r\n\r\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: \u2018I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.\u2019 \u2018What am I to do?\u2019 asked the little man. \u2018Late at night, when the king\u2019s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant\u2019s work for me.\u2019 The manikin said: \u2018That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.\u2019 When twelve o\u2019clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess. \u2018Aha! are you there?\u2019 cried the soldier, \u2018get to your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.\u2019 When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: \u2018Pull off my boots,\u2019 and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream. \u2018I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,\u2019 said she, \u2018and taken into a soldier\u2019s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.\u2019 \u2018The dream may have been true,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.\u2019 But unseen by the king, the manikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant\u2019s work until cock-crow.\r\n\r\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying: \u2018It must have rained peas, last night.\u2019 \u2018We must think of something else,\u2019 said the king; \u2018keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.\u2019 The black manikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier\u2019s house it would go badly with him. \u2018Do what I bid you,\u2019 replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter\u2019s shoe. It was found at the soldier\u2019s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him: \u2018Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.\u2019 His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. \u2018Have no fear,\u2019 said the latter to his master. \u2018Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.\u2019 Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king. \u2018What is it?\u2019 asked the king. \u2018That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.\u2019 \u2018You may smoke three,\u2019 answered the king, \u2018but do not imagine that I will spare your life.\u2019 Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: \u2018What does my lord command?\u2019 \u2018Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill.\u2019 Then the manikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier\u2019s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.\r\nTHE RAVEN\r\n\r\nThere was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: \u2018I wish you were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.\u2019 Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was turned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time, and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.\r\n\r\nLong after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew near, the raven said, \u2018I am by birth a king\u2019s daughter, but am now under the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.\u2019 \u2018What am I to do?\u2019 he asked. She replied, \u2018Go farther into the wood until you come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me. I shall drive there in my carriage at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon for three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, \u2018Alas! I know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable to save me.\u2019 The man assured her again that he would on no account touch a thing to eat or drink.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and said, \u2018Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you something to eat and drink.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018No,\u2019 answered the man, \u2018I will neither eat not drink.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, \u2018If you will not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing,\u2019 and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and drank.\r\n\r\nAs it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two o\u2019clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, \u2018I know he has fallen asleep.\u2019 When she entered the garden, there she found him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank again.\r\n\r\nTowards two o\u2019clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep. As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully to herself, \u2018I know he has fallen asleep.\u2019 She went as before to look for him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\r\n\r\nThe following day the old woman said to him, \u2018What is this? You are not eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?\u2019\r\n\r\nHe answered, \u2018I may not and will not either eat or drink.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him, and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and took a deep draught.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in the garden to await the king\u2019s daughter, but he felt even more overcome with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down, he slept like a log. At two o\u2019clock the raven could be seen approaching, and this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her horses, were black.\r\n\r\nShe was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, \u2018I know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.\u2019 She found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid a letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food and drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words: \u2018I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me free; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.\u2019 She then returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\r\n\r\nWhen the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved at heart, and said, \u2018She has no doubt been here and driven away again, and it is now too late for me to save her.\u2019 Then his eyes fell on the things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening, thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.\r\n\r\nHe found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, \u2018If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.\u2019 However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him, he called out, \u2018It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.\u2019 \u2018I would rather you let that alone,\u2019 said the man, \u2018for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger.\u2019 \u2018If that is so,\u2019 replied the giant, \u2018I will leave you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to his heart\u2019s content. When he had finished his supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg. The giant said, \u2018I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns, villages, and houses.\u2019 So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle, but could not find it. \u2018Never mind,\u2019 he said, \u2018I have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,\u2019 but they searched in vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. \u2018How shall I be able to get there?\u2019 asked the man. \u2018I have two hours to spare,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I must then return to look after the child who is in our care.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues of the castle, where he left him, saying, \u2018You will be able to walk the remainder of the way yourself.\u2019 The man journeyed on day and night till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated, however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, \u2018I will remain here and wait for her,\u2019 so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king\u2019s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.\r\n\r\nLooking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he called out to them, \u2018God be with you.\u2019 They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious. \u2018God be with you,\u2019 he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting. A third time he called out, \u2018God be with you,\u2019 and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick, and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would separate. On hearing this, the man said, \u2018I will give you something in exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got, but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove whether all you have told me about your three things is true.\u2019 The robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after another, crying, \u2018There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!\u2019\r\n\r\nAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick, and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger, and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom. \u2018That is my own ring,\u2019 she exclaimed, \u2018and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me free.\u2019\r\n\r\nShe sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere. Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him, and said, \u2018Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.\u2019\r\nTHE GOLDEN GOOSE\r\n\r\nThere was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\r\n\r\n[*] Simpleton\r\n\r\nIt happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day, and said: \u2018Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.\u2019 But the clever son answered: \u2018If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,\u2019 and he left the little man standing and went on.\r\n\r\nBut when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man\u2019s doing.\r\n\r\nAfter this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine. But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: \u2018What I give you will be taken away from myself; be off!\u2019 and he left the little man standing and went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home.\r\n\r\nThen Dummling said: \u2018Father, do let me go and cut wood.\u2019 The father answered: \u2018Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you do not understand anything about it.\u2019 But Dummling begged so long that at last he said: \u2018Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself.\u2019 His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and greeting him, said: \u2018Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.\u2019 Dummling answered: \u2018I have only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat.\u2019 So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: \u2018Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the roots.\u2019 Then the little man took leave of him.\r\n\r\nDummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers.\r\n\r\nThe eldest thought: \u2018I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather,\u2019 and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\r\n\r\nThe second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast.\r\n\r\nAt last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out: \u2018Keep away; for goodness\u2019 sake keep away!\u2019 But she did not understand why she was to keep away. \u2018The others are there,\u2019 she thought, \u2018I may as well be there too,\u2019 and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they had to spend the night with the goose.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out, without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right, wherever his legs took him.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said: \u2018For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?\u2019 At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind.\r\n\r\nBefore long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: \u2018Hi! your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a christening today!\u2019 and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it.\r\n\r\nWhilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the king\u2019s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: \u2018I have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018There, I can help you,\u2019 said Dummling, \u2018just come with me and you shall be satisfied.\u2019\r\n\r\nHe led him into the king\u2019s cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: \u2018I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger.\u2019\r\n\r\nAt this Dummling was glad, and said: \u2018Get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full.\u2019 He led him to the king\u2019s palace where all the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished. Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on water. \u2018As soon as you come sailing back in it,\u2019 said he, \u2018you shall have my daughter for wife.\u2019\r\n\r\nDummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted, he said: \u2018Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.\u2019 Then he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The wedding was celebrated, and after the king\u2019s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\r\nTHE WATER OF LIFE\r\n\r\nLong before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill\u2014so ill that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved at their father\u2019s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him. \u2018I know what would,\u2019 said the little old man; \u2018it is the Water of Life. If he could have a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.\u2019 Then the eldest son said, \u2018I will soon find it\u2019: and he went to the sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as it was the only thing that could save him. \u2018No,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I had rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in your journey.\u2019 But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the prince thought to himself, \u2018If I bring my father this water, he will make me sole heir to his kingdom.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said, \u2018Prince, whither so fast?\u2019 \u2018What is that to thee, you ugly imp?\u2019 said the prince haughtily, and rode on.\r\n\r\nBut the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\r\n\r\nMeantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son\u2019s return, till at last the second son said, \u2018Father, I will go in search of the Water of Life.\u2019 For he thought to himself, \u2018My brother is surely dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.\u2019 The king was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish. So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done, and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the mountains, saying, as before, \u2018Prince, prince, whither so fast?\u2019 \u2018Mind your own affairs, busybody!\u2019 said the prince scornfully, and rode on.\r\n\r\nBut the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.\r\n\r\nWhen the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and said, \u2018Prince, whither so fast?\u2019 And the prince said, \u2018I am going in search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die: can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!\u2019 \u2018Do you know where it is to be found?\u2019 asked the dwarf. \u2018No,\u2019 said the prince, \u2018I do not. Pray tell me if you know.\u2019 \u2018Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey\u2019s end, and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and marry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he wanted before the clock struck twelve.\r\n\r\nHe walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him that it snapped off a piece of his heel.\r\n\r\nWhen he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, \u2018You have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole armies, and the bread will never fail you.\u2019 Then the prince thought to himself, \u2018I cannot go home to my father without my brothers\u2019; so he said, \u2018My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?\u2019 \u2018I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,\u2019 said the dwarf, \u2018because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.\u2019 The prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set them free, though unwillingly, saying, \u2018Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.\u2019 Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them, and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water of Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThen they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy\u2019s army with it; and thus the kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage the two eldest said to themselves, \u2018Our brother has got the water which we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the kingdom, which is our right\u2019; so they were full of envy and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to their journey\u2019s end, the youngest son brought his cup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however, had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father, but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them. He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days. Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, \u2018Well, brother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble and we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we will let you off.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one day, when the king\u2019s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said, \u2018My friend, what is the matter with you?\u2019 \u2018I cannot and dare not tell you,\u2019 said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said, \u2018Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will forgive you.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the huntsman; \u2018the king has ordered me to shoot you.\u2019 The prince started at this, and said, \u2018Let me live, and I will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my father, and do you give me your shabby one.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the huntsman; \u2018I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not have shot you.\u2019 Then he took the prince\u2019s coat, and gave him the shabby one, and went away through the wood.\r\n\r\nSome time after, three grand embassies came to the old king\u2019s court, with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their people. This touched the old king\u2019s heart, and he thought his son might still be guiltless, and said to his court, \u2018O that my son were still alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!\u2019 \u2018He is still alive,\u2019 said the huntsman; \u2018and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.\u2019 At this the king was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode straight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was not the right one; and that they must send him away at once.\r\n\r\nThe time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to look at it, and he thought to himself, \u2018It is a pity to ride upon this beautiful road\u2019; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road he took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go about his business.\r\n\r\nThe second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it, he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to himself, \u2018What a pity it is that anything should tread here!\u2019 Then he too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too must go away about his business; and away he went.\r\n\r\nNow when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest in which he had lain hid for fear of his father\u2019s anger, and set out in search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything; how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne all those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape, and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they went to nobody knew and nobody cared.\r\n\r\nAnd now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess. And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.\r\n\r\n  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\r\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\r\n  And feasted and frolick\u2019d I can\u2019t tell how long.\r\n\r\nTHE TWELVE HUNTSMEN\r\n\r\nThere was once a king\u2019s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end. Then he said to his beloved: \u2018I must now go and leave you, I give you a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch you.\u2019 So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: \u2018Dear son, I wished to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,\u2019 and he named a certain king\u2019s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: \u2018Yes, dear father, your will shall be done,\u2019 and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father, and caused the king\u2019s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her: \u2018Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have whatsoever you will.\u2019 She thought for a moment and said: \u2018Dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.\u2019 The father said: \u2018If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,\u2019 and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the king\u2019s daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen\u2019s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the huntsmen\u2019s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit. Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said: \u2018Yes,\u2019 and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the king\u2019s twelve huntsmen.\r\n\r\nThe king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he said to the king: \u2018You think you have twelve huntsmen?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the king, \u2018they are twelve huntsmen.\u2019 The lion continued: \u2018You are mistaken, they are twelve girls.\u2019 The king said: \u2018That cannot be true! How will you prove that to me?\u2019 \u2018Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber,\u2019 answered the lion, \u2018and then you will soon see. Men have a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.\u2019 The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a servant of the king\u2019s who favoured the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them and repeated everything, and said: \u2018The lion wants to make the king believe that you are girls.\u2019 Then the king\u2019s daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens: \u2018Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.\u2019 So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: \u2018You have lied to me, they walk just like men.\u2019 The lion said: \u2018They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.\u2019 The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.\r\n\r\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king\u2019s daughter said to her eleven girls: \u2018Show some constraint, and do not look round at the spinning-wheels.\u2019 And next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion: \u2018You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.\u2019 The lion replied: \u2018They have restrained themselves.\u2019 The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.\r\n\r\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting, news came that the king\u2019s bride was approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: \u2018You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that.\u2019 He sent a messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.\r\nTHE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nThere was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth, in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf. \u2018Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?\u2019 said he to the merchant; \u2018what is it you take so deeply to heart?\u2019 \u2018If you would do me any good I would willingly tell you,\u2019 said the merchant. \u2018Who knows but I may?\u2019 said the little man: \u2018tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will find I may be of some use.\u2019 Then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left but that little plot of land. \u2018Oh, trouble not yourself about that,\u2019 said the dwarf; \u2018only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.\u2019 The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.\r\n\r\nBut as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\r\n\r\nAbout a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.\r\n\r\nMeantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel said, \u2018Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be too much for the little man.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, the father and son went out together to the place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At last the boy said to him. \u2018Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?\u2019 Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him. \u2018Have you brought me what you said you would?\u2019 said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again, \u2018What do you want here?\u2019 The dwarf said, \u2018I come to talk with your father, not with you.\u2019 \u2018You have cheated and taken in my father,\u2019 said the son; \u2018pray give him up his bond at once.\u2019 \u2018Fair and softly,\u2019 said the little old man; \u2018right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.\u2019 \u2018You must have my consent to that first,\u2019 said Heinel, \u2018so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.\u2019 The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company.\r\n\r\nSo, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.\r\n\r\nThe boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. \u2018Here,\u2019 said he to himself, \u2018must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.\u2019 So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\r\n\r\nNow the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, \u2018Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she promised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come: their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour. They will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do what they will\u2014beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you\u2014bear all; only speak not a word, and at twelve o\u2019clock they must go away. The second night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life and health.\u2019 And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.\r\n\r\nThey lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was against his going, and said, \u2018I know well that misfortunes will come upon us if you go.\u2019 However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, \u2018Take this ring, and put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father\u2019s house.\u2019 Then he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near the town where his father lived.\r\n\r\nHeinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock, and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father\u2019s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that he was his son, and said, \u2018Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am really your son?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said his mother, \u2018our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on his right arm.\u2019 Then he showed them the mark, and they knew that what he had said was true.\r\n\r\nHe next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant said, \u2018that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels about in a shepherd\u2019s frock!\u2019 At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.\r\n\r\nOne day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat himself down, and said, \u2018I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my head in your lap, and sleep a while.\u2019 As soon as he had fallen asleep, however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger. \u2018I can never go back to my father\u2019s house,\u2019 said he; \u2018they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my kingdom.\u2019\r\n\r\nSo saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three giants were sharing their father\u2019s goods; and as they saw him pass they cried out and said, \u2018Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods between us.\u2019 Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy\u2019s head whenever the wearer gave the words, \u2018Heads off!\u2019; a cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a moment he was a fly. \u2018The cloak is very well,\u2019 said he: \u2018now give me the sword.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said they; \u2018not unless you undertake not to say, \u201cHeads off!\u201d for if you do we are all dead men.\u2019 So they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also; and the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.\r\n\r\nAs Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and drink, her plate and cup were always empty.\r\n\r\nUpon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she to herself, \u2018was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment still seem to bind me?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018False and fickle one!\u2019 said he. \u2018One indeed came who set thee free, and he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to have had such treatment from thee?\u2019 Then he went out and sent away the company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back to the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him. However, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them if they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he drew his sword. \u2018Heads Off!\u2019 cried he; and with the word the traitors\u2019 heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king of the Golden Mountain.\r\nDOCTOR KNOWALL\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said the doctor, \u2018that is soon managed.\u2019 \u2018What must I do?\u2019 asked the peasant. \u2018In the first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: \u201cI am Doctor Knowall,\u201d and have that nailed up above your house-door.\u2019 The peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money. \u2018Oh, yes, but Grete, my wife, must go too.\u2019 The lord was willing, and let both of them have a seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came to the nobleman\u2019s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat. \u2018Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,\u2019 said he, and he seated himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: \u2018Grete, that was the first,\u2019 meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: \u2018That is the first thief,\u2019 and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: \u2018The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.\u2019 The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: \u2018Grete, that is the second.\u2019 This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the peasant again said: \u2018Grete, that is the third.\u2019 The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried: \u2018Ah, poor Crabb.\u2019 When the lord heard that, he cried: \u2018There! he knows it; he must also know who has the money!\u2019\r\n\r\nOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said: \u2018My lord, now will I search in my book where the gold is hidden.\u2019 The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: \u2018I know you are there, so you had better come out!\u2019 Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: \u2018That man knows everything!\u2019 Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.\r\nTHE SEVEN RAVENS\r\n\r\nThere was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter. Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be christened.\r\n\r\nSo the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the young men stay so long. \u2018Surely,\u2019 said he, \u2018the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play\u2019; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day more beautiful.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said they, \u2018she is beautiful indeed, but still \u2018tis a pity that her brothers should have been lost for her sake.\u2019 Then she was much grieved, and went to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.\r\n\r\nShe took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and journeyed till she came to the world\u2019s end; then she came to the sun, but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, \u2018I smell flesh and blood this way!\u2019 so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, and said, \u2018If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live.\u2019 The little girl took the piece of wood, rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done? She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.\r\n\r\nAs she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, \u2018What are you seeking for?\u2019 \u2018I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,\u2019 answered she. Then the dwarf said, \u2018My masters are not at home; but if you will wait till they come, pray step in.\u2019 Now the little dwarf was getting their dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had brought with her fall into the last glass.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the dwarf said, \u2018Here come my masters.\u2019 When they came in, they wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after the other,\r\n\r\n\u2018Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my little glass?\u2019\r\n\r\n \u2018Caw! Caw! well I ween\r\n  Mortal lips have this way been.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s, and said, \u2018O that our little sister would but come! then we should be free.\u2019 When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home.\r\nTHE WEDDING OF MRS FOX\r\n\r\nFIRST STORY\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves. The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:\r\n\r\n \u2018What may you be about, Miss Cat?\r\n  Do you sleep or do you wake?\u2019\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n \u2018I am not sleeping, I am waking,\r\n  Would you know what I am making?\r\n  I am boiling warm beer with butter,\r\n  Will you be my guest for supper?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018No, thank you, miss,\u2019 said the fox, \u2018what is Mrs Fox doing?\u2019 The maid replied:\r\n\r\n \u2018She is sitting in her room,\r\n  Moaning in her gloom,\r\n  Weeping her little eyes quite red,\r\n  Because old Mr Fox is dead.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her.\u2019 \u2018Certainly, young sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\r\n  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\r\n \u2018Mistress Fox, are you inside?\u2019\r\n \u2018Oh, yes, my little cat,\u2019 she cried.\r\n \u2018A wooer he stands at the door out there.\u2019\r\n \u2018What does he look like, my dear?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?\u2019 \u2018Oh, no,\u2019 answered the cat, \u2018he has only one.\u2019 \u2018Then I will not have him.\u2019\r\n\r\nMiss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:\r\n\r\n \u2018Now open the gates and doors all wide,\r\n  And carry old Mr Fox outside.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs Fox out of the house.\r\n\r\nSECOND STORY\r\n\r\nWhen old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The wolf greeted her, and said:\r\n\r\n \u2018Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,\r\n  How comes it that alone you sit?\r\n  What are you making good?\u2019\r\n\r\nThe cat replied:\r\n\r\n \u2018In milk I\u2019m breaking bread so sweet,\r\n  Will you be my guest, and eat?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018No, thank you, Mrs Cat,\u2019 answered the wolf. \u2018Is Mrs Fox not at home?\u2019\r\n\r\nThe cat said:\r\n\r\n \u2018She sits upstairs in her room,\r\n  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\r\n  Bewailing her trouble so sore,\r\n  For old Mr Fox is no more.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe wolf answered:\r\n\r\n \u2018If she\u2019s in want of a husband now,\r\n  Then will it please her to step below?\u2019\r\n  The cat runs quickly up the stair,\r\n  And lets her tail fly here and there,\r\n  Until she comes to the parlour door.\r\n  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:\r\n \u2018Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\r\n  If you\u2019re in want of a husband now,\r\n  Then will it please you to step below?\r\n\r\nMrs Fox asked: \u2018Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed mouth?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered the cat. \u2018Then he won\u2019t do for me.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young fox. Then Mrs Fox said: \u2018Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a little pointed mouth?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018he has.\u2019 \u2018Then let him come upstairs,\u2019 said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast.\r\n\r\n \u2018Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\r\n  Up with the window, fling out my old man!\r\n  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\r\n  Yet of his wife he never thought,\r\n  But ate up every one he caught.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.\r\nTHE SALAD\r\n\r\nAs a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood, there came up a little old woman, and said to him, \u2018Good day, good day; you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me something to eat.\u2019 The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, \u2018Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It is the bird\u2019s heart that will bring you this good luck.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, \u2018If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.\u2019 When he had gone a hundred steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the huntsman, \u2018this is wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said\u2019; then he shot into the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the flock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it. Then the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took out the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay the piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and at last thought to himself, \u2018Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am at home? I will go out into the world and look about me.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his neck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and said to the young lady, \u2018There is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird\u2019s heart that brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.\u2019 Meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, \u2018I have been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want\u2019; but the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady\u2019s eyes, and doing everything that she wished. Then the old woman said, \u2018Now is the time for getting the bird\u2019s heart.\u2019 So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady\u2019s, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize.\r\n\r\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said the old witch, \u2018we have got the bird\u2019s heart, but not the wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.\u2019 \u2018Let us leave him that,\u2019 said the young lady; \u2018he has already lost his wealth.\u2019 Then the witch was very angry, and said, \u2018Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing, and I must and will have it.\u2019 So she did as the old woman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, \u2018What makes you so sad?\u2019 \u2018Alas! dear sir,\u2019 said she, \u2018yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies\u2014man cannot.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s all your grief,\u2019 said the huntsman, \u2018I\u2019ll take you there with all my heart\u2019; so he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, \u2018Let us sit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand any longer.\u2019 So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished herself home again.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock, he said, \u2018Alas! what roguery there is in the world!\u2019 and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as he saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, \u2018I can only save myself by feigning to be asleep\u2019; so he laid himself down as if he were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed him with his foot, and said, \u2018What worm is this that lies here curled up?\u2019 \u2018Tread upon him and kill him,\u2019 said the second. \u2018It\u2019s not worth the trouble,\u2019 said the third; \u2018let him live, he\u2019ll go climbing higher up the mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.\u2019 And they passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they were gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat there a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a whirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden, and he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\r\n\r\nThen he looked around him, and said, \u2018I wish I had something to eat, if not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.\u2019 At last he thought to himself, \u2018I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen me.\u2019 So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with horror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again.\r\n\r\nThen he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and the bad salad, and thought to himself, \u2018This will help me to my fortune again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.\u2019 So he went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over brown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; \u2018I am so tired,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I can go no farther.\u2019 \u2018Countryman,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018who are you? and what is your business?\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 said he, \u2018a messenger sent by the king to find the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither, and I don\u2019t know that I can carry it farther.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they longed to taste it, and said, \u2018Dear countryman, let us just taste it.\u2019 \u2018To be sure,\u2019 answered he; \u2018I have two heads of it with me, and will give you one\u2019; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, \u2018I don\u2019t know where the salad can be.\u2019 Then he thought something must have happened, and said, \u2018I will go into the kitchen and see.\u2019 And as he went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the ground. \u2018All right!\u2019 said he; \u2018those two have had their share.\u2019 Then he took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady, saying, \u2018I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.\u2019 So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying away.\r\n\r\nThen the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might know him. \u2018Now you shall be paid for your roguery,\u2019 said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window. \u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 said the miller. \u2018I have three tiresome beasts here,\u2019 said the other; \u2018if you will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you, I will pay you whatever you ask.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the miller; \u2018but how shall I treat them?\u2019 Then the huntsman said, \u2018Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes\u2019: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten. After this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he wanted.\r\n\r\nSome days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was dead; \u2018The other two,\u2019 said he, \u2018are alive and eat, but are so sorrowful that they cannot last long.\u2019 Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, \u2018O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for the bird\u2019s heart, I will give it you too.\u2019 But he said, \u2018Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean to make you my wife.\u2019 So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died.\r\nTHE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS\r\n\r\nA certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said: \u2018There\u2019s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!\u2019 When anything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal place, he answered: \u2018Oh, no father, I\u2019ll not go there, it makes me shudder!\u2019 for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: \u2018Oh, it makes us shudder!\u2019 The younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. \u2018They are always saying: \u201cIt makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!\u201d It does not make me shudder,\u2019 thought he. \u2018That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing!\u2019\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day: \u2018Hearken to me, you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.\u2019 \u2018Well, father,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I am quite willing to learn something\u2014indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don\u2019t understand that at all yet.\u2019 The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself: \u2018Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is! He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe father sighed, and answered him: \u2018You shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.\u2019\r\n\r\nSoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. \u2018Just think,\u2019 said he, \u2018when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that be all,\u2019 replied the sexton, \u2018he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon polish him.\u2019 The father was glad to do it, for he thought: \u2018It will train the boy a little.\u2019 The sexton therefore took him into his house, and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell. \u2018You shall soon learn what shuddering is,\u2019 thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole. \u2018Who is there?\u2019 cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir. \u2018Give an answer,\u2019 cried the boy, \u2018or take yourself off, you have no business here at night.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: \u2018What do you want here?\u2014speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!\u2019 The sexton thought: \u2018He can\u2019t mean to be as bad as his words,\u2019 uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton\u2019s wife waited a long time for her husband, but he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: \u2018Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before you did.\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 replied the boy, \u2018but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he. I should be sorry if it were.\u2019 The woman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.\r\n\r\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy\u2019s father, \u2018Your boy,\u2019 cried she, \u2018has been the cause of a great misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.\u2019 The father was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. \u2018What wicked tricks are these?\u2019 said he. \u2018The devil must have put them into your head.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 he replied, \u2018do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go away.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the father, \u2018I have nothing but unhappiness with you. Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate, understand one art which will support me.\u2019 \u2018Learn what you will,\u2019 spoke the father, \u2018it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you. Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.\u2019 \u2018Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to himself: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\u2019 Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows, the man said to him: \u2018Look, there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker\u2019s daughter, and are now learning how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will soon learn how to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that is all that is wanted,\u2019 answered the youth, \u2018it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the morning.\u2019 Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: \u2018If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!\u2019 And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven. Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he said: \u2018Take care, or I will hang you up again.\u2019 The dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: \u2018If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,\u2019 and he hung them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers, and said: \u2018Well do you know how to shudder?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered he, \u2018how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burnt.\u2019 Then the man saw that he would not get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: \u2018Such a youth has never come my way before.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to himself: \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019 A waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: \u2018From whence do you come?\u2019 \u2018I know not.\u2019 \u2018Who is your father?\u2019 \u2018That I may not tell you.\u2019 \u2018What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 replied the youth, \u2018I do so wish I could shudder, but no one can teach me how.\u2019 \u2018Enough of your foolish chatter,\u2019 said the waggoner. \u2018Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.\u2019 The youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite loudly: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\u2019 The host who heard this, laughed and said: \u2018If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.\u2019 \u2018Ah, be silent,\u2019 said the hostess, \u2018so many prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut the youth said: \u2018However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.\u2019 He let the host have no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the youth went next morning to the king, and said: \u2018If it be allowed, I will willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: \u2018You may ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must be things without life.\u2019 Then he answered: \u2018Then I ask for a fire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe king had these things carried into the castle for him during the day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019 said he, \u2018but I shall not learn it here either.\u2019 Towards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly from one corner: \u2018Au, miau! how cold we are!\u2019 \u2018You fools!\u2019 cried he, \u2018what are you crying about? If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.\u2019 And when he had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said: \u2018Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 he replied, \u2018but just show me your paws.\u2019 Then they stretched out their claws. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.\u2019 Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast. \u2018I have looked at your fingers,\u2019 said he, \u2018and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\u2019 and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: \u2018Away with you, vermin,\u2019 and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. \u2018That is the very thing for me,\u2019 said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over the whole of the castle. \u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 said he, \u2018but go faster.\u2019 Then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up in the air, got out and said: \u2018Now anyone who likes, may drive,\u2019 and lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: \u2018After all it is a pity,\u2014for so handsome a man.\u2019 The youth heard it, got up, and said: \u2018It has not come to that yet.\u2019 Then the king was astonished, but very glad, and asked how he had fared. \u2018Very well indeed,\u2019 answered he; \u2018one night is past, the two others will pass likewise.\u2019 Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: \u2018I never expected to see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the fire, and once more began his old song: \u2018If I could but shudder!\u2019 When midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and fell before him. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 cried he, \u2018another half belongs to this. This is not enough!\u2019 Then the uproar began again, there was a roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.\u2019 When he had done that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a hideous man was sitting in his place. \u2018That is no part of our bargain,\u2019 said the youth, \u2018the bench is mine.\u2019 The man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men\u2019s legs and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The youth also wanted to play and said: \u2018Listen you, can I join you?\u2019 \u2018Yes, if you have any money.\u2019 \u2018Money enough,\u2019 replied he, \u2018but your balls are not quite round.\u2019 Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round. \u2018There, now they will roll better!\u2019 said he. \u2018Hurrah! now we\u2019ll have fun!\u2019 He played with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came to inquire after him. \u2018How has it fared with you this time?\u2019 asked he. \u2018I have been playing at nine-pins,\u2019 he answered, \u2018and have lost a couple of farthings.\u2019 \u2018Have you not shuddered then?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said he, \u2018I have had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly: \u2018If I could but shudder.\u2019 When it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a coffin. Then he said: \u2018Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who died only a few days ago,\u2019 and he beckoned with his finger, and cried: \u2018Come, little cousin, come.\u2019 They placed the coffin on the ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will warm you a little,\u2019 and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man\u2019s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he thought to himself: \u2018When two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,\u2019 and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the youth, \u2018See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?\u2019 The dead man, however, got up and cried: \u2018Now will I strangle you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018What!\u2019 said he, \u2018is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go into your coffin again,\u2019 and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. \u2018I cannot manage to shudder,\u2019 said he. \u2018I shall never learn it here as long as I live.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible. He was old, however, and had a long white beard. \u2018You wretch,\u2019 cried he, \u2018you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.\u2019 \u2018Not so fast,\u2019 replied the youth. \u2018If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.\u2019 \u2018I will soon seize you,\u2019 said the fiend. \u2018Softly, softly, do not talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.\u2019 \u2018We shall see,\u2019 said the old man. \u2018If you are stronger, I will let you go\u2014come, we will try.\u2019 Then he led him by dark passages to a smith\u2019s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground. \u2018I can do better than that,\u2019 said the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and in it caught the old man\u2019s beard. \u2018Now I have you,\u2019 said the youth. \u2018Now it is your turn to die.\u2019 Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold. \u2018Of these,\u2019 said he, \u2018one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third yours.\u2019 In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in darkness. \u2018I shall still be able to find my way out,\u2019 said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire. Next morning the king came and said: \u2018Now you must have learnt what shuddering is?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 he answered; \u2018what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.\u2019 \u2018Then,\u2019 said the king, \u2018you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.\u2019 \u2018That is all very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018but still I do not know what it is to shudder!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still said always: \u2018If I could but shudder\u2014if I could but shudder.\u2019 And this at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: \u2018I will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.\u2019 She went out to the stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: \u2018Oh, what makes me shudder so?\u2014what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!\u2019\r\nKING GRISLY-BEARD\r\n\r\nA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she only made sport of them.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank\u2014kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: \u2018He\u2019s as round as a tub,\u2019 said she. The next was too tall: \u2018What a maypole!\u2019 said she. The next was too short: \u2018What a dumpling!\u2019 said she. The fourth was too pale, and she called him \u2018Wallface.\u2019 The fifth was too red, so she called him \u2018Coxcomb.\u2019 The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker\u2019s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. \u2018Look at him,\u2019 said she; \u2018his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.\u2019 So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.\r\n\r\nBut the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door.\r\n\r\nTwo days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, \u2018Let him come in.\u2019 So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said, \u2018You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.\u2019 The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, \u2018I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.\u2019 So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, \u2018Now get ready to go\u2014you must not stay here\u2014you must travel on with your husband.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came to a great wood. \u2018Pray,\u2019 said she, \u2018whose is this wood?\u2019 \u2018It belongs to King Grisly-beard,\u2019 answered he; \u2018hadst thou taken him, all had been thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018would that I had married King Grisly-beard!\u2019 Next they came to some fine meadows. \u2018Whose are these beautiful green meadows?\u2019 said she. \u2018They belong to King Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 said she; \u2018would that I had married King Grisly-beard!\u2019\r\n\r\nThen they came to a great city. \u2018Whose is this noble city?\u2019 said she. \u2018It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?\u2019 \u2018That is no business of mine,\u2019 said the fiddler: \u2018why should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?\u2019\r\n\r\nAt last they came to a small cottage. \u2018What a paltry place!\u2019 said she; \u2018to whom does that little dirty hole belong?\u2019 Then the fiddler said, \u2018That is your and my house, where we are to live.\u2019 \u2018Where are your servants?\u2019 cried she. \u2018What do we want with servants?\u2019 said he; \u2018you must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.\u2019 But the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, \u2018Wife, we can\u2019t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.\u2019 Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. \u2018I see this work won\u2019t do,\u2019 said he: \u2018try and spin; perhaps you will do that better.\u2019 So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. \u2018See now,\u2019 said the fiddler, \u2018you are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got! However, I\u2019ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 sighed she, \u2018if any of my father\u2019s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!\u2019\r\n\r\nBut her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall, and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do. \u2018Ah! what will become of me?\u2019 said she; \u2018what will my husband say?\u2019 So she ran home and told him all. \u2018Who would have thought you would have been so silly,\u2019 said he, \u2018as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of work, so I have been to the king\u2019s palace, and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will have plenty to eat.\u2019\r\n\r\nThus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left, and on this they lived.\r\n\r\nShe had not been there long before she heard that the king\u2019s eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich meats, which she put into her basket to take home.\r\n\r\nAll on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king\u2019s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, \u2018Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party.\r\nIRON HANS\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. \u2018Perhaps some accident has befallen him,\u2019 said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: \u2018Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three.\u2019 But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again. From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The king, however, would not give his consent, and said: \u2018It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.\u2019 The huntsman replied: \u2018Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with safety.\r\n\r\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran thither and said: \u2018Give me my ball out.\u2019 \u2018Not till you have opened the door for me,\u2019 answered the man. \u2018No,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018I will not do that; the king has forbidden it,\u2019 and ran away. The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: \u2018Open my door,\u2019 but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said: \u2018I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.\u2019 Then the wild man said: \u2018It lies under your mother\u2019s pillow, you can get it there.\u2019 The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: \u2018Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!\u2019 The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.\r\n\r\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him: \u2018You will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.\u2019 He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said: \u2018Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.\u2019 The boy placed himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said: \u2018What has happened to the well?\u2019 \u2018Nothing nothing,\u2019 he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said: \u2018You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let anything go in.\u2019 By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew what had happened. \u2018You have let a hair fall into the well,\u2019 said he. \u2018I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me.\u2019\r\n\r\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said: \u2018Take the handkerchief off.\u2019 Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. \u2018You have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is. But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: \u201cIron Hans,\u201d and then I will come and help you. My power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance.\u2019\r\n\r\nThen the king\u2019s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king\u2019s notice, and he said: \u2018When you come to the royal table you must take your hat off.\u2019 He answered: \u2018Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.\u2019 Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener\u2019s boy.\r\n\r\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king\u2019s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him: \u2018Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.\u2019 He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: \u2018How can you take the king\u2019s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.\u2019 \u2018Oh, no,\u2019 replied the boy, \u2018the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.\u2019 When he got into the room, the king\u2019s daughter said: \u2018Take your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.\u2019 He again said: \u2018I may not, I have a sore head.\u2019 She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said: \u2018I present them to your children, they can play with them.\u2019 The following day the king\u2019s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army. Then said the gardener\u2019s boy: \u2018I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.\u2019 The others laughed, and said: \u2018Seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you.\u2019 When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called \u2018Iron Hans\u2019 three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said: \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 \u2018I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.\u2019 \u2018That you shall have, and still more than you ask for.\u2019 Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king\u2019s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans. \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 asked the wild man. \u2018Take back your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.\u2019 All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. \u2018I am not the one who carried away the victory,\u2019 said he, \u2018but a strange knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.\u2019 The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did not know, and said: \u2018He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.\u2019 She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said: \u2018He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying: \u201cHere comes our hobblety jib back again!\u201d They asked, too: \u201cUnder what hedge have you been lying sleeping all the time?\u201d So he said: \u201cI did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.\u201d And then he was still more ridiculed.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe king said to his daughter: \u2018I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown man will show himself.\u2019 When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 asked he. \u2018That I may catch the king\u2019s daughter\u2019s golden apple.\u2019 \u2018It is as safe as if you had it already,\u2019 said Iron Hans. \u2018You shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.\u2019 When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king\u2019s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\r\n\r\nOn the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew angry, and said: \u2018That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.\u2019 He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off with it, the king\u2019s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth\u2019s leg with the point of his sword. The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth\u2019s head, and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\r\n\r\nThe following day the king\u2019s daughter asked the gardener about his boy. \u2018He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head. But the king\u2019s daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. \u2018Are you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?\u2019 asked the king. \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered he, \u2018and here the apples are,\u2019 and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the king. \u2018If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.\u2019 \u2018If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener\u2019s boy; tell me, who is your father?\u2019 \u2018My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.\u2019 \u2018I well see,\u2019 said the king, \u2018that I owe my thanks to you; can I do anything to please you?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered he, \u2018that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.\u2019 The maiden laughed, and said: \u2018He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener\u2019s boy,\u2019 and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: \u2018I am Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.\u2019\r\nCAT-SKIN\r\n\r\nThere was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, \u2018Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.\u2019 Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, \u2018this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.\u2019 So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.\r\n\r\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his courtiers, \u2018May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.\u2019 When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, \u2018Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.\u2019 And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, \u2018Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.\u2019 And thus she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made.\r\n\r\nWhen all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses\u2014of the sun, the moon, and the stars\u2014up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday.\r\n\r\nNow as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark. \u2018Look sharp!\u2019 said the king to the huntsmen, \u2018and see what sort of game lies there.\u2019 And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, \u2018In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said the king, \u2018if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.\u2019 So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, \u2018I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on me and take me with you.\u2019 Then they said, \u2018Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.\u2019 So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king\u2019s palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and said, \u2018Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.\u2019 And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty work.\r\n\r\nThus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. \u2018Ah! pretty princess!\u2019 thought she, \u2018what will now become of thee?\u2019 But it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king\u2019s castle, so she said to the cook, \u2018May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will take care and stand behind the door.\u2019 And the cook said, \u2018Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour\u2019s time, to rake out the ashes.\u2019 Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less than a king\u2019s daughter. But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, \u2018I never saw any one half so beautiful.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, \u2018Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king\u2019s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don\u2019t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.\u2019\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king\u2019s soup, and toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, \u2018You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.\u2019 Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. \u2018I did,\u2019 answered the cook. But the king said, \u2018That is not true; it was better done than you could do it.\u2019 Then he answered, \u2018To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin did.\u2019 \u2018Then let Cat-skin come up,\u2019 said the king: and when she came he said to her, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018I am a poor child,\u2019 said she, \u2018that has lost both father and mother.\u2019 \u2018How came you in my palace?\u2019 asked he. \u2018I am good for nothing,\u2019 said she, \u2018but to be scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.\u2019 \u2018But how did you get the ring that was in the soup?\u2019 asked the king. Then she would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent her away again about her business.\r\n\r\nAfter a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let her go up and see it as before. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said he, \u2018but come again in half an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.\u2019 Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king\u2019s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.\r\n\r\nBut when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time, it happened just the same as before. \u2018You must be a witch, Cat-skin,\u2019 said the cook; \u2018for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine.\u2019 However, he let her go up as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time. When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her fingers white.\r\n\r\nThen she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king\u2019s soup; and as soon as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\r\n\r\nThen he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said, \u2018You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.\u2019 And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\r\nSNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED\r\n\r\nThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when there was nothing to do.\r\n\r\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said: \u2018We will not leave each other,\u2019 Rose-red answered: \u2018Never so long as we live,\u2019 and their mother would add: \u2018What one has she must share with the other.\u2019\r\n\r\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\r\n\r\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not worry on their account.\r\n\r\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children.\r\n\r\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother\u2019s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother\u2019s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: \u2018Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,\u2019 and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said: \u2018Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.\u2019 Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door.\r\n\r\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother\u2019s bed. But the bear began to speak and said: \u2018Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Poor bear,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.\u2019 Then she cried: \u2018Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\u2019 So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said: \u2018Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little\u2019; so they brought the broom and swept the bear\u2019s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out: \u2018Leave me alive, children,\r\n\r\n  Snow-white, Rose-red,\r\n  Will you beat your wooer dead?\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: \u2018You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.\u2019 As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived.\r\n\r\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: \u2018Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.\u2019 \u2018Where are you going, then, dear bear?\u2019 asked Snow-white. \u2018I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.\u2019\r\n\r\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: \u2018Why do you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?\u2019 \u2018What are you up to, little man?\u2019 asked Rose-red. \u2018You stupid, prying goose!\u2019 answered the dwarf: \u2018I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast. \u2018I will run and fetch someone,\u2019 said Rose-red. \u2018You senseless goose!\u2019 snarled the dwarf; \u2018why should you fetch someone? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t be impatient,\u2019 said Snow-white, \u2018I will help you,\u2019 and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself: \u2018Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!\u2019 and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 said Rose-red; \u2018you surely don\u2019t want to go into the water?\u2019 \u2018I am not such a fool!\u2019 cried the dwarf; \u2018don\u2019t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?\u2019 The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\r\n\r\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he screamed out: \u2018Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man\u2019s face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!\u2019 Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\r\n\r\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\r\n\r\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice: \u2018Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you clumsy creatures!\u2019 Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their business in town.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared at them. \u2018Why do you stand gaping there?\u2019 cried the dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried: \u2018Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy\u2019s sake eat them!\u2019 The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.\r\n\r\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them: \u2018Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.\u2019 Then they recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in gold. \u2018I am a king\u2019s son,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.\r\n\r\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red.\r\n\r\nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout their lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology, and although Wilhelm\u2019s work was hampered by poor health the brothers collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of \u2018Nursery and Household Tales\u2019 in 1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about fifty stories \u2018with the amusement of some young friends principally in view.\u2019 They have been an essential ingredient of children\u2019s reading ever since.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GRIMMS' FAIRY TALES ***\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

We can\u2019t do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don\u2019t,\u201d and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the little we should spend would do any good. We\u2019ve each got a dollar, and the army wouldn\u2019t be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I\u2019ve wanted it so long,\u201d said Jo, who was a bookworm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI planned to spend mine in new music,\u201d said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall get a nice box of Faber\u2019s drawing pencils; I really need them,\u201d said Amy decidedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother didn\u2019t say anything about our money, and she won\u2019t wish us to give up everything. Let\u2019s each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I\u2019m sure we work hard enough to earn it,\u201d cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know I do\u2014teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I\u2019m longing to enjoy myself at home,\u201d began Meg, in the complaining tone again.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have half such a hard time as I do,\u201d said Jo. \u201cHow would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you\u2019re ready to fly out the window or cry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can\u2019t practice well at all.\u201d And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe any of you suffer as I do,\u201d cried Amy, \u201cfor you don\u2019t have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don\u2019t know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn\u2019t rich, and insult you when your nose isn\u2019t nice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you mean libel, I\u2019d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa was a pickle bottle,\u201d advised Jo, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what I mean, and you needn\u2019t be statirical about it. It\u2019s proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,\u201d returned Amy, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t peck at one another, children. Don\u2019t you wish we had the money Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy and good we\u2019d be, if we had no worries!\u201d said Meg, who could remember better times.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in spite of their money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have to work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJo does use such slang words!\u201d observed Amy, with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug.\r\n\r\nJo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Jo. It\u2019s so boyish!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI detest rude, unladylike girls!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBirds in their little nests agree,\u201d sang Beth, the peacemaker, with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the \u201cpecking\u201d ended for that time.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, girls, you are both to be blamed,\u201d said Meg, beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \u201cYou are old enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn\u2019t matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I\u2019ll wear it in two tails till I\u2019m twenty,\u201d cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane. \u201cI hate to think I\u2019ve got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster! It\u2019s bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy\u2019s games and work and manners! I can\u2019t get over my disappointment in not being a boy. And it\u2019s worse than ever now, for I\u2019m dying to go and fight with Papa. And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor Jo! It\u2019s too bad, but it can\u2019t be helped. So you must try to be contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us girls,\u201d said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs for you, Amy,\u201d continued Meg, \u201cyou are altogether too particular and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you\u2019ll grow up an affected little goose, if you don\u2019t take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don\u2019t try to be elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as Jo\u2019s slang.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\u201d asked Beth, ready to share the lecture.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dear, and nothing else,\u201d answered Meg warmly, and no one contradicted her, for the \u2018Mouse\u2019 was the pet of the family.\r\n\r\nAs young readers like to know \u2018how people look\u2019, we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses, chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.\r\n\r\nMargaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn\u2019t like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her \u2018Little Miss Tranquility\u2019, and the name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone brightened to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d get her some with my dollar,\u201d said Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shall!\u201d cried Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the oldest,\u201d began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, \u201cI\u2019m the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll do,\u201d said Beth, \u201clet\u2019s each get her something for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s like you, dear! What will we get?\u201d exclaimed Jo.\r\n\r\nEveryone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \u201cI shall give her a nice pair of gloves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArmy shoes, best to be had,\u201d cried Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\u201d said Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a little bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it won\u2019t cost much, so I\u2019ll have some left to buy my pencils,\u201d added Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow will we give the things?\u201d asked Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles. Don\u2019t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\u201d answered Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\u201d said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise her. We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night,\u201d said Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to act any more after this time. I\u2019m getting too old for such things,\u201d observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about \u2018dressing-up\u2019 frolics.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best actress we\u2019ve got, and there\u2019ll be an end of everything if you quit the boards,\u201d said Jo. \u201cWe ought to rehearse tonight. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don\u2019t choose to make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down easily, I\u2019ll drop. If I can\u2019t, I shall fall into a chair and be graceful. I don\u2019t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\u201d returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo it this way. Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room, crying frantically, \u2018Roderigo! Save me! Save me!\u2019\u201d and away went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\r\n\r\nAmy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her \u201cOw!\u201d was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. \u201cIt\u2019s no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don\u2019t blame me. Come on, Meg.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break. Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect. Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, \u201cHa! Ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best we\u2019ve had yet,\u201d said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You\u2019re a regular Shakespeare!\u201d exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d replied Jo modestly. \u201cI do think The Witches Curse, an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I\u2019d like to try Macbeth, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing part. \u2018Is that a dagger that I see before me?\u201d muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s the toasting fork, with Mother\u2019s shoe on it instead of the bread. Beth\u2019s stage-struck!\u201d cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cGlad to find you so merry, my girls,\u201d said a cheery voice at the door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a \u2018can I help you\u2019 look about her which was truly delightful. She was not elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, dearies, how have you got on today? There was so much to do, getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn\u2019t come home to dinner. Has anyone called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched. Beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.\r\n\r\nAs they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly happy face, \u201cI\u2019ve got a treat for you after supper.\u201d\r\n\r\nA quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her napkin, crying, \u201cA letter! A letter! Three cheers for Father!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\u201d said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\r\n\r\n\u201cHurry and get done! Don\u2019t stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate, Amy,\u201d cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.\r\n\r\nBeth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\u201d said Meg warmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan\u2014what\u2019s its name? Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help him,\u201d exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\u201d sighed Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen will he come home, Marmee?\u201d asked Beth, with a little quiver in her voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won\u2019t ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching. Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news, and only at the end did the writer\u2019s heart over-flow with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cGive them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women.\u201d Everybody sniffed when they came to that part. Jo wasn\u2019t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother\u2019s shoulder and sobbed out, \u201cI am a selfish girl! But I\u2019ll truly try to be better, so he mayn\u2019t be disappointed in me by-and-by.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe all will,\u201d cried Meg. \u201cI think too much of my looks and hate to work, but won\u2019t any more, if I can help it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try and be what he loves to call me, \u2018a little woman\u2019 and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else,\u201d said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\r\n\r\nBeth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home.\r\n\r\nMrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo\u2019s words, by saying in her cheery voice, \u201cDo you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress when you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a Celestial City.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and passing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,\u201d said Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,\u201d said Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top. If I wasn\u2019t too old for such things, I\u2019d rather like to play it over again,\u201d said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get before Father comes home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Mother? Where are our bundles?\u201d asked Amy, who was a very literal young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cEach of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather think she hasn\u2019t got any,\u201d said her mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have. Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice pianos, and being afraid of people.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeth\u2019s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us do it,\u201d said Meg thoughtfully. \u201cIt is only another name for trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to be good, it\u2019s hard work and we forget, and don\u2019t do our best.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions, like Christian. What shall we do about that?\u201d asked Jo, delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your guidebook,\u201d replied Mrs. March.\r\n\r\nThey talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but tonight no one grumbled. They adopted Jo\u2019s plan of dividing the long seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them.\r\n\r\nAt nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed. No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. Meg had a voice like a flute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could lisp...\r\n\r\nCrinkle, crinkle, \u2019ittle \u2019tar,\r\n\r\nand it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer. The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby.\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\nA MERRY CHRISTMAS\r\n\r\nJo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she remembered her mother\u2019s promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey. She woke Meg with a \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d and bade her see what was under her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature, which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.\r\n\r\n\u201cGirls,\u201d said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \u201cMother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through the day.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow good Meg is! Come, Amy, let\u2019s do as they do. I\u2019ll help you with the hard words, and they\u2019ll explain things if we don\u2019t understand,\u201d whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters\u2019 example.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad mine is blue,\u201d said Amy. and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is Mother?\u201d asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodness only knows. Some poor creeter came a-beggin\u2019, and your ma went straight off to see what was needed. There never was such a woman for givin\u2019 away vittles and drink, clothes and firin\u2019,\u201d replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything ready,\u201d said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time. \u201cWhy, where is Amy\u2019s bottle of cologne?\u201d she added, as the little flask did not appear.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on it, or some such notion,\u201d replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow nice my handkerchiefs look, don\u2019t they? Hannah washed and ironed them for me, and I marked them all myself,\u201d said Beth, looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless the child! She\u2019s gone and put \u2018Mother\u2019 on them instead of \u2018M. March\u2019. How funny!\u201d cried Jo, taking one up.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg\u2019s initials are M.M., and I don\u2019t want anyone to use these but Marmee,\u201d said Beth, looking troubled.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,\u201d said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Mother. Hide the basket, quick!\u201d cried Jo, as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall.\r\n\r\nAmy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\u201d asked Meg, surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so early.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, Jo! I didn\u2019t mean anyone should know till the time came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave all my money to get it, and I\u2019m truly trying not to be selfish any more.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \u2018a trump\u2019, while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the minute I was up, and I\u2019m so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201cMerry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books. We read some, and mean to every day,\u201d they all cried in chorus.\r\n\r\n\u201cMerry Christmas, little daughters! I\u2019m glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came before we began!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\u201d asked Beth eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall take the cream and the muffings,\u201d added Amy, heroically giving up the article she most liked.\r\n\r\nMeg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one big plate.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d do it,\u201d said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \u201cYou shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and no one laughed at the queer party.\r\n\r\nA poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.\r\n\r\nHow the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.\r\n\r\n\u201cAch, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!\u201d said the poor woman, crying for joy.\r\n\r\n\u201cFunny angels in hoods and mittens,\u201d said Jo, and set them to laughing.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.\r\n\r\n\u201cDas ist gut!\u201d \u201cDie Engel-kinder!\u201d cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a \u2018Sancho\u2019 ever since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn\u2019t get any of it. And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\u201d said Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\r\n\r\nNot a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave quite an elegant air to the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for Marmee!\u201d cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to the seat of honor.\r\n\r\nBeth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy\u2019s cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to work.\r\n\r\nThe morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out. The big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.\r\n\r\nNo gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart\u2019s content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture, were Jo\u2019s chief treasures and appeared on all occasions. The smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew apart, and the operatic tragedy began.\r\n\r\n\u201cA gloomy wood,\u201d according to the one playbill, was represented by a few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the distance. This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo\u2019s voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding, \u201cWhat ho, minion! I need thee!\u201d\r\n\r\nOut came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter.\r\n\r\nHither, hither, from thy home,\r\nAiry sprite, I bid thee come!\r\nBorn of roses, fed on dew,\r\nCharms and potions canst thou brew?\r\nBring me here, with elfin speed,\r\nThe fragrant philter which I need.\r\nMake it sweet and swift and strong,\r\nSpirit, answer now my song!\r\n\r\nA soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang...\r\n\r\nHither I come,\r\nFrom my airy home,\r\nAfar in the silver moon.\r\nTake the magic spell,\r\nAnd use it well,\r\nOr its power will vanish soon!\r\n\r\nAnd dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch\u2019s feet, the spirit vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play.\r\n\r\nA good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb. A tower rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver dress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of course. Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones. Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came the grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo\u2019s shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when \u201cAlas! Alas for Zara!\u201d she forgot her train. It caught in the window, the tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins.\r\n\r\nA universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \u201cI told you so! I told you so!\u201d With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t laugh! Act as if it was all right!\u201d and, ordering Roderigo up, banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara. She also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made.\r\n\r\nAct third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to free the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming and hides, sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little servant, \u201cBear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall come anon.\u201d The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando, the \u2018minion\u2019, carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.\r\n\r\nThis was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the villain\u2019s death. He was called before the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together.\r\n\r\nAct fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window, informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if he will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love.\r\n\r\nAct fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He wishes her to go into a convent, but she won\u2019t hear of it, and after a touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn\u2019t make them happy. The bag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely softens the stern sire. He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro\u2019s blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\r\n\r\nTumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless with laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah appeared, with \u201cMrs. March\u2019s compliments, and would the ladies walk down to supper.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table, they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty. There was ice cream, actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great bouquets of hot house flowers.\r\n\r\nIt quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it fairies?\u201d asked Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cSanta Claus,\u201d said Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother did it.\u201d And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\u201cAunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,\u201d cried Jo, with a sudden inspiration.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\u201d replied Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Laurence boy\u2019s grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into his head? We don\u2019t know him!\u201d exclaimed Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cHannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an odd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father years ago, and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse, and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat boy put it into his head, I know he did! He\u2019s a capital fellow, and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he\u2019d like to know us but he\u2019s bashful, and Meg is so prim she won\u2019t let me speak to him when we pass,\u201d said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean the people who live in the big house next door, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked one of the girls. \u201cMy mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says he\u2019s very proud and doesn\u2019t like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his grandson shut up, when he isn\u2019t riding or walking with his tutor, and makes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn\u2019t come. Mother says he\u2019s very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOur cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some day, for he needs fun, I\u2019m sure he does,\u201d said Jo decidedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I\u2019ve no objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure what was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mercy you didn\u2019t, Mother!\u201d laughed Jo, looking at her boots. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have another play sometime that he can see. Perhaps he\u2019ll help act. Wouldn\u2019t that be jolly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!\u201d And Meg examined her flowers with great interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are lovely. But Beth\u2019s roses are sweeter to me,\u201d said Mrs. March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.\r\n\r\nBeth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \u201cI wish I could send my bunch to Father. I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t having such a merry Christmas as we are.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\nTHE LAURENCE BOY\r\n\r\n\u201cJo! Jo! Where are you?\u201d cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window. This was Jo\u2019s favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn\u2019t mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for tomorrow night!\u201d cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a little dance on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u2019 Marmee is willing we should go, now what shall we wear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins, because we haven\u2019t got anything else?\u201d answered Jo with her mouth full.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I only had a silk!\u201d sighed Meg. \u201cMother says I may when I\u2019m eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us. Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can\u2019t take any out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and my gloves will do, though they aren\u2019t as nice as I\u2019d like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can\u2019t get any new ones, so I shall have to go without,\u201d said Jo, who never troubled herself much about dress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must have gloves, or I won\u2019t go,\u201d cried Meg decidedly. \u201cGloves are more important than anything else. You can\u2019t dance without them, and if you don\u2019t I should be so mortified.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay still. I don\u2019t care much for company dancing. It\u2019s no fun to go sailing round. I like to fly about and cut capers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are so careless. She said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn\u2019t get you any more this winter. Can\u2019t you make them do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained they are. That\u2019s all I can do. No! I\u2019ll tell you how we can manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove dreadfully,\u201d began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go without. I don\u2019t care what people say!\u201d cried Jo, taking up her book.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may have it, you may! Only don\u2019t stain it, and do behave nicely. Don\u2019t put your hands behind you, or stare, or say \u2018Christopher Columbus!\u2019 will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be as prim as I can and not get into any scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let me finish this splendid story.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Meg went away to \u2018accept with thanks\u2019, look over her dress, and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.\r\n\r\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the all-important business of \u2018getting ready for the party\u2019. Simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.\r\n\r\n\u201cOught they to smoke like that?\u201d asked Beth from her perch on the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the dampness drying,\u201d replied Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a queer smell! It\u2019s like burned feathers,\u201d observed Amy, smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, now I\u2019ll take off the papers and you\u2019ll see a cloud of little ringlets,\u201d said Jo, putting down the tongs.\r\n\r\nShe did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, oh, oh! What have you done? I\u2019m spoiled! I can\u2019t go! My hair, oh, my hair!\u201d wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust my luck! You shouldn\u2019t have asked me to do it. I always spoil everything. I\u2019m so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I\u2019ve made a mess,\u201d groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t spoiled. Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I\u2019ve seen many girls do it so,\u201d said Amy consolingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cServes me right for trying to be fine. I wish I\u2019d let my hair alone,\u201d cried Meg petulantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,\u201d said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\r\n\r\nAfter various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the united exertions of the entire family Jo\u2019s hair was got up and her dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg\u2019s in silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin. Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect \u201cquite easy and fine\u201d. Meg\u2019s high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and Jo\u2019s nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave a good time, dearies!\u201d said Mrs. March, as the sisters went daintily down the walk. \u201cDon\u2019t eat much supper, and come away at eleven when I send Hannah for you.\u201d As the gate clashed behind them, a voice cried from a window...\r\n\r\n\u201cGirls, girls! Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\u201d cried Jo, adding with a laugh as they went on, \u201cI do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\u201d replied Meg, who had a good many little \u2018aristocratic tastes\u2019 of her own.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash right? And does my hair look very bad?\u201d said Meg, as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s dressing room after a prolonged prink.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind me by a wink, will you?\u201d returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, winking isn\u2019t ladylike. I\u2019ll lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulder straight, and take short steps, and don\u2019t shake hands if you are introduced to anyone. It isn\u2019t the thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn\u2019t that music gay?\u201d\r\n\r\nDown they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn\u2019t care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life. She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone. She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face to face with the \u2018Laurence boy\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, I didn\u2019t know anyone was here!\u201d stammered Jo, preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.\r\n\r\nBut the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little startled, \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, stay if you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShan\u2019t I disturb you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit. I only came here because I don\u2019t know many people and felt rather strange at first, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo did I. Don\u2019t go away, please, unless you\u2019d rather.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to be polite and easy, \u201cI think I\u2019ve had the pleasure of seeing you before. You live near us, don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNext door.\u201d And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo\u2019s prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.\r\n\r\nThat put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her heartiest way, \u201cWe did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGrandpa sent it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you put it into his head, didn\u2019t you, now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is your cat, Miss March?\u201d asked the boy, trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cNicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I am not Miss March, I\u2019m only Jo,\u201d returned the young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not Mr. Laurence, I\u2019m only Laurie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLaurie Laurence, what an odd name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy first name is Theodore, but I don\u2019t like it, for the fellows called me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hate my name, too, so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thrashed \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.\u201d And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like to dance, Miss Jo?\u201d asked Laurie, looking as if he thought the name suited her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is lively. In a place like this I\u2019m sure to upset something, tread on people\u2019s toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and let Meg sail about. Don\u2019t you dance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes. You see I\u2019ve been abroad a good many years, and haven\u2019t been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbroad!\u201d cried Jo. \u201cOh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people describe their travels.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie didn\u2019t seem to know where to begin, but Jo\u2019s eager questions soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I wish I\u2019d been there!\u201d cried Jo. \u201cDid you go to Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe spent last winter there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you talk French?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo say some! I can read it, but can\u2019t pronounce.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow nicely you do it! Let me see ... you said, \u2018Who is the young lady in the pretty slippers\u2019, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOui, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is pretty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and quiet, and dances like a lady.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie\u2019s bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo\u2019s gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the \u2018Laurence boy\u2019 better than ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.\r\n\r\n\u201cCurly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy, and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was on the tip of Jo\u2019s tongue to ask, but she checked herself in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your books, no, I mean studying hard.\u201d And Jo blushed at the dreadful \u2018pegging\u2019 which had escaped her.\r\n\r\nLaurie smiled but didn\u2019t seem shocked, and answered with a shrug. \u201cNot for a year or two. I won\u2019t go before seventeen, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you but fifteen?\u201d asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she had imagined seventeen already.\r\n\r\n\u201cSixteen, next month.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow I wish I was going to college! You don\u2019t look as if you liked it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don\u2019t like the way fellows do either, in this country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, \u201cThat\u2019s a splendid polka! Why don\u2019t you go and try it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you will come too,\u201d he answered, with a gallant little bow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t, for I told Meg I wouldn\u2019t, because...\u201d There Jo stopped, and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t tell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it\u2019s nicely mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it. You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Laurie didn\u2019t laugh. He only looked down a minute, and the expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, \u201cNever mind that. I\u2019ll tell you how we can manage. There\u2019s a long hall out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring. When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students\u2019 festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m ever going to get home,\u201d she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I\u2019m sorry. But I don\u2019t see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all night,\u201d answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I dare say I can\u2019t get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it\u2019s a long way to the stable, and no one to send.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed! It\u2019s past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can\u2019t stop here, for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I\u2019ll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask Laurie. He will go,\u201d said Jo, looking relieved as the idea occurred to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy, no! Don\u2019t ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers, and put these slippers with our things. I can\u2019t dance anymore, but as soon as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are going out to supper now. I\u2019ll stay with you. I\u2019d rather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t stir.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet, and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\u201d exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg\u2019s glove by scrubbing her gown with it.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie, with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone shook me, and here I am in a nice state,\u201d answered Jo, glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.\r\n\r\n\u201cToo bad! I was looking for someone to give this to. May I take it to your sister?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thank you! I\u2019ll show you where she is. I don\u2019t offer to take it myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a \u2018nice boy\u2019. They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the midst of a quiet game of Buzz, with two or three other young people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation of pain.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! Don\u2019t say anything,\u201d she whispered, adding aloud, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I turned my foot a little, that\u2019s all,\u201d and limped upstairs to put her things on.\r\n\r\nHannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits\u2019 end, till she decided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she said, came up and offered his grandfather\u2019s carriage, which had just come for him, he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so early! You can\u2019t mean to go yet?\u201d began Jo, looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI always go early, I do, truly! Please let me take you home. It\u2019s all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat settled it, and telling him of Meg\u2019s mishap, Jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and elegant. Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the girls talked over their party in freedom.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a capital time. Did you?\u201d asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and making herself comfortable.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, till I hurt myself. Sallie\u2019s friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,\u201d answered Meg, cheering up at the thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from. Was he nice?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, very! His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I had a delicious redowa with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie and I couldn\u2019t help laughing. Did you hear us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but it was very rude. What were you about all that time, hidden away there?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at home. With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...\r\n\r\n\u201cTell about the party! Tell about the party!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith what Meg called \u2018a great want of manners\u2019 Jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening.\r\n\r\n\u201cI declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me,\u201d said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\u201d And I think Jo was quite right.\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\nBURDENS\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,\u201d sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish it was Christmas or New Year\u2019s all the time. Wouldn\u2019t it be fun?\u201d answered Jo, yawning dismally.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It\u2019s like other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I\u2019m so fond of luxury,\u201d said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t have it, so don\u2019t let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I\u2019m sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I\u2019ve learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so light that I shan\u2019t mind her.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis idea tickled Jo\u2019s fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg didn\u2019t brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children, seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I\u2019m pretty or not?\u201d she muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. \u201cI shall have to toil and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly and sour, because I\u2019m poor and can\u2019t enjoy my life as other girls do. It\u2019s a shame!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn\u2019t at all agreeable at breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak.\r\n\r\nBeth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned, and she couldn\u2019t find her rubbers. Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready.\r\n\r\nMrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn\u2019t suit her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere never was such a cross family!\u201d cried Jo, losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon her hat.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the crossest person in it!\u201d returned Amy, washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeth, if you don\u2019t keep these horrid cats down cellar I\u2019ll have them drowned,\u201d exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.\r\n\r\nJo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she couldn\u2019t remember how much nine times twelve was.\r\n\r\n\u201cGirls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off by the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,\u201d cried Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them \u2018muffs\u2019, for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings.\r\n\r\nHannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two.\r\n\r\n\u201cCuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Marmee. We are a set of rascals this morning, but we\u2019ll come home regular angels. Now then, Meg!\u201d And Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.\r\n\r\nThey always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them. Somehow it seemed as if they couldn\u2019t have got through the day without that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen,\u201d cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t use such dreadful expressions,\u201d replied Meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like good strong words that mean something,\u201d replied Jo, catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether.\r\n\r\n\u201cCall yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a wretch and I don\u2019t choose to be called so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can\u2019t sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow ridiculous you are, Jo!\u201d But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cLucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can always find something funny to keep me up. Don\u2019t croak any more, but come home jolly, there\u2019s a dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.\r\n\r\nMargaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary. As she said, she was \u2018fond of luxury\u2019, and her chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings\u2019 she daily saw all she wanted, for the children\u2019s older sisters were just out, and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.\r\n\r\nJo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her offer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady\u2019s will, but the unworldly Marches only said...\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady wouldn\u2019t speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo at a friend\u2019s, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady\u2019s fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and, to every one\u2019s surprise, got on remarkably well with her irascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn\u2019t bear it longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her.\r\n\r\nThe moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy chair, devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures like a regular bookworm. But, like all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of a song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice called, \u201cJosy-phine! Josy-phine!\u201d and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle, or read Belsham\u2019s Essays by the hour together.\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was, she had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn\u2019t read, run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training she received at Aunt March\u2019s was just what she needed, and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual \u201cJosy-phine!\u201d\r\n\r\nBeth was too bashful to go to school. It had been tried, but she suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to Soldiers\u2019 Aid Societies, Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could. She was a housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid. If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll have a good night, my poor dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but a very human little girl, she often \u2018wept a little weep\u2019 as Jo said, because she couldn\u2019t take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn\u2019t keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee and the girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself, \u201cI know I\u2019ll get my music some time, if I\u2019m good.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.\r\n\r\nIf anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she would have answered at once, \u201cMy nose.\u201d When she was a baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big nor red, like poor \u2018Petrea\u2019s\u2019, it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cLittle Raphael,\u201d as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort. Her little airs and graces were much admired, so were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words. She had a plaintive way of saying, \u201cWhen Papa was rich we did so-and-so,\u201d which was very touching, and her long words were considered \u2018perfectly elegant\u2019 by the girls.\r\n\r\nAmy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities. She had to wear her cousin\u2019s clothes. Now Florence\u2019s mama hadn\u2019t a particle of taste, and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy\u2019s artistic eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy only comfort,\u201d she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \u201cis that Mother doesn\u2019t take tucks in my dresses whenever I\u2019m naughty, as Maria Parks\u2019s mother does. My dear, it\u2019s really dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can\u2019t come to school. When I think of this deggerredation, I feel that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow sky-rockets on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg was Amy\u2019s confidant and monitor, and by some strange attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth\u2019s. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family. The two older girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way, \u2018playing mother\u2019 they called it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas anybody got anything to tell? It\u2019s been such a dismal day I\u2019m really dying for some amusement,\u201d said Meg, as they sat sewing together that evening.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I\u2019ll tell you about it,\u201d began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. \u201cI was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I could, and be done with it,\u201d said I, trying not to be saucy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and think them over while she just \u2018lost\u2019 herself for a moment. She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the Vicar of Wakefield out of my pocket, and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I\u2019d just got to where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though she only said...\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s all about. Go back and begin it, child.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBack I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could. Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly, \u2018I\u2019m afraid it tires you, ma\u2019am. Shan\u2019t I stop now?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way, \u2018Finish the chapter, and don\u2019t be impertinent, miss\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid she own she liked it?\u201d asked Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, bless you, no! But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that she didn\u2019t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming. What a pleasant life she might have if only she chose! I don\u2019t envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,\u201d added Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d said Meg, \u201cthat I\u2019ve got something to tell. It isn\u2019t funny, like Jo\u2019s story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came home. At the Kings\u2019 today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn\u2019t see how red and swollen their eyes were. I didn\u2019t ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn\u2019t any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do,\u201d said Amy, shaking her head, as if her experience of life had been a deep one. \u201cSusie Perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, \u2018Young ladies, my eye is upon you!\u2019 coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was parrylized with fright, but she went, and oh, what do you think he did? He took her by the ear\u2014the ear! Just fancy how horrid!\u2014and led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so everyone could see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t the girls laugh at the picture?\u201d asked Jo, who relished the scrape.\r\n\r\n\u201cLaugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know she did. I didn\u2019t envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldn\u2019t have made me happy after that. I never, never should have got over such a agonizing mortification.\u201d And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at dinner, but I forgot,\u201d said Beth, putting Jo\u2019s topsy-turvy basket in order as she talked. \u201cWhen I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn\u2019t see me, for I kept behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn\u2019t any dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day\u2019s work. Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said \u2018No\u2019, rather crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. He told her to \u2018go along and cook it\u2019, and she hurried off, so happy! Wasn\u2019t it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence\u2019s bed in heaven would be \u2018aisy\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen they had laughed at Beth\u2019s story, they asked their mother for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, \u201cAs I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and anxious.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Have you sons in the army?\u2019 I asked, for the note he brought was not to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and I\u2019m going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.\u2019 he answered quietly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have done a great deal for your country, sir,\u2019 I said, feeling respect now, instead of pity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not a mite more than I ought, ma\u2019am. I\u2019d go myself, if I was any use. As I ain\u2019t, I give my boys, and give \u2019em free.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I\u2019d given one man and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them. I had all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,\u201d said Jo, after a minute\u2019s silence.\r\n\r\nMrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.\u201d (Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew diligently.) \u201cThese girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were constantly saying, \u2018If only we had this,\u2019 or \u2018If we could only do that,\u2019 quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things they actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy, and she said, \u2018When you feel discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.\u2019\u201d (Here Jo looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not done yet.)\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money couldn\u2019t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people\u2019s houses, another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady who couldn\u2019t enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable as it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman\u2019s advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!\u201d cried Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like that kind of sermon. It\u2019s the sort Father used to tell us,\u201d said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo\u2019s cushion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more careful than ever now, for I\u2019ve had warning from Susie\u2019s downfall,\u201d said Amy morally.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe needed that lesson, and we won\u2019t forget it. If we do so, you just say to us, as old Chloe did in Uncle Tom, \u2018Tink ob yer marcies, chillen!\u2019 \u2018Tink ob yer marcies!\u2019\u201d added Jo, who could not, for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though she took it to heart as much as any of them.\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\nBEING NEIGHBORLY\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat in the world are you going to do now, Jo?\u201d asked Meg one snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing out for exercise,\u201d answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think two long walks this morning would have been enough! It\u2019s cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire, as I do,\u201d said Meg with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever take advice! Can\u2019t keep still all day, and not being a pussycat, I don\u2019t like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I\u2019m going to find some.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg went back to toast her feet and read Ivanhoe, and Jo began to dig paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the Marches\u2019 house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers, which then surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.\r\n\r\nYet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.\r\n\r\nTo Jo\u2019s lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to begin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat boy is suffering for society and fun,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cHis grandpa does not know what\u2019s good for him, and keeps him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young and lively. I\u2019ve a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of \u2018going over\u2019 was not forgotten. And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try what could be done. She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took a survey. All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d thought Jo, \u201cPoor boy! All alone and sick this dismal day. It\u2019s a shame! I\u2019ll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and then say a kind word to him.\u201d\r\n\r\nUp went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and flourished her broom as she called out...\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you do? Are you sick?\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter, thank you. I\u2019ve had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing. It\u2019s dull as tombs up here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you read?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot much. They won\u2019t let me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t somebody read to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGrandpa does sometimes, but my books don\u2019t interest him, and I hate to ask Brooke all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave someone come and see you then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone I\u2019d like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head is weak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there some nice girl who\u2019d read and amuse you? Girls are quiet and like to play nurse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know any.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know us,\u201d began Jo, then laughed and stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I do! Will you come, please?\u201d cried Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not quiet and nice, but I\u2019ll come, if Mother will let me. I\u2019ll go ask her. Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was \u2018a little gentleman\u2019, and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color, and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, then a decided voice, asking for \u2018Mr. Laurie\u2019, and a surprised-looking servant came running up to announce a young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, show her up, it\u2019s Miss Jo,\u201d said Laurie, going to the door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth\u2019s three kittens in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere I am, bag and baggage,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cMother sent her love, and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats would be comforting. I knew you\u2019d laugh at them, but I couldn\u2019t refuse, she was so anxious to do something.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Beth\u2019s funny loan was just the thing, for in laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat looks too pretty to eat,\u201d he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy\u2019s pet geranium.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it. Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It\u2019s so simple you can eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat. What a cozy room this is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don\u2019t know how to make them mind. It worries me though.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth brushed, so\u2014and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so\u2014and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now then, you\u2019re fixed.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...\r\n\r\n\u201cHow kind you are! Yes, that\u2019s what it wanted. Now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?\u201d and Jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you! I\u2019ve read all those, and if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather talk,\u201d answered Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit. I\u2019ll talk all day if you\u2019ll only set me going. Beth says I never know when to stop.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket?\u201d asked Laurie with interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s Beth. She\u2019s my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you find that out?\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie colored up, but answered frankly, \u201cWhy, you see I often hear you calling to one another, and when I\u2019m alone up here, I can\u2019t help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when the lamps are lighted, it\u2019s like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother. Her face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can\u2019t help watching it. I haven\u2019t got any mother, you know.\u201d And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.\r\n\r\nThe solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo\u2019s warm heart. She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you\u2019d come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she\u2019d do you heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would dance. Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we\u2019d have jolly times. Wouldn\u2019t your grandpa let you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think he would, if your mother asked him. He\u2019s very kind, though he does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he\u2019s afraid I might be a bother to strangers,\u201d began Laurie, brightening more and more.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn\u2019t think you\u2019d be a bother. We want to know you, and I\u2019ve been trying to do it this ever so long. We haven\u2019t been here a great while, you know, but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn\u2019t mind much what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn\u2019t stay here, you know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked, then you\u2019ll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won\u2019t last long if you keep going.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie turned red again, but wasn\u2019t offended at being accused of bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you like your school?\u201d asked the boy, changing the subject, after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about her, well pleased.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go to school, I\u2019m a businessman\u2014girl, I mean. I go to wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\u201d answered Jo.\r\n\r\nLaurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just in time that it wasn\u2019t manners to make too many inquiries into people\u2019s affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nJo liked his good breeding, and didn\u2019t mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where she reveled.\r\n\r\nLaurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please,\u201d he said, taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.\r\n\r\nMuch elated with her success, Jo did \u2018tell on\u2019, all about their plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to talking about books, and to Jo\u2019s delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandfather is out, so you needn\u2019t be afraid,\u201d said Laurie, getting up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d returned Jo, with a toss of the head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you are!\u201d exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his moods.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy. And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat richness!\u201d sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \u201cTheodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\u201d she added impressively.\r\n\r\n\u201cA fellow can\u2019t live on books,\u201d said Laurie, shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite.\r\n\r\nBefore he could say more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with alarm, \u201cMercy me! It\u2019s your grandpa!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,\u201d returned the boy, looking wicked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don\u2019t know why I should be. Marmee said I might come, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re any the worse for it,\u201d said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I\u2019m only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. It was so pleasant, I couldn\u2019t bear to stop,\u201d said Laurie gratefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctor to see you, sir,\u201d and the maid beckoned as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,\u201d said Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me. I\u2019m happy as a cricket here,\u201d answered Jo.\r\n\r\nLaurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, \u201cI\u2019m sure now that I shouldn\u2019t be afraid of him, for he\u2019s got kind eyes, though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own. He isn\u2019t as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.\r\n\r\nPoor Jo blushed till she couldn\u2019t blush any redder, and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, \u201cSo you\u2019re not afraid of me, hey?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot much, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think me as handsome as your grandfather?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot quite, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a tremendous will, have I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI only said I thought so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you like me in spite of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat answer pleased the old gentleman. He gave a short laugh, shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, \u201cYou\u2019ve got your grandfather\u2019s spirit, if you haven\u2019t his face. He was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited her exactly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\u201d was the next question, sharply put.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly trying to be neighborly, sir.\u201d And Jo told how her visit came about.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could, for we don\u2019t forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\u201d said Jo eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cTut, tut, tut! That was the boy\u2019s affair. How is the poor woman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoing nicely, sir.\u201d And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust her father\u2019s way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother some fine day. Tell her so. There\u2019s the tea bell, we have it early on the boy\u2019s account. Come down and go on being neighborly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like to have me, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t ask you, if I didn\u2019t.\u201d And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would Meg say to this?\u201d thought Jo, as she was marched away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\u201d said the old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d come, sir,\u201d he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant little glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman.\u201d And having pulled the boy\u2019s hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color, light, and life in the boy\u2019s face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, the lad is lonely. I\u2019ll see what these little girls can do for him,\u201d thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.\r\n\r\nIf the Laurences had been what Jo called \u2018prim and poky\u2019, she would not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full. Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, \u201cPlease give these to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room, but Jo\u2019s attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which stood open.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you play?\u201d she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he answered modestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect and regard for the \u2018Laurence\u2019 boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn\u2019t put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugarplums are not good for him. His music isn\u2019t bad, but I hope he will do as well in more important things. Going? well, I\u2019m much obliged to you, and I hope you\u2019ll come again. My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor Jo.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something amiss. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it was me. He doesn\u2019t like to hear me play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo need of that. I am not a young lady, and it\u2019s only a step. Take care of yourself, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but you will come again, I hope?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you promise to come and see us after you are well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood night, Laurie!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood night, Jo, good night!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen all the afternoon\u2019s adventures had been told, the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother, why didn\u2019t Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\u201d asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie\u2019s father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he \u2018glowered\u2019 as Jo said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, how romantic!\u201d exclaimed Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow silly!\u201d said Jo. \u201cLet him be a musician if he wants to, and not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I suppose. Italians are always nice,\u201d said Meg, who was a little sentimental.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to him, hardly,\u201d cried Jo, who was not sentimental.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe meant the blanc mange, I suppose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he?\u201d And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw such a girl! You don\u2019t know a compliment when you get it,\u201d said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think they are great nonsense, and I\u2019ll thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun. Laurie\u2019s a nice boy and I like him, and I won\u2019t have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. We\u2019ll all be good to him because he hasn\u2019t got any mother, and he may come over and see us, mayn\u2019t he, Marmee?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t call myself a child, and I\u2019m not in my teens yet,\u201d observed Amy. \u201cWhat do you say, Beth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking about our \u2018Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u2019,\u201d answered Beth, who had not heard a word. \u201cHow we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying, and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be our Palace Beautiful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have got to get by the lions first,\u201d said Jo, as if she rather liked the prospect.\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\nBETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL\r\n\r\nThe big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March\u2019s motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that \u201cthe Marches were regularly splendid girls.\u201d With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship of these simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always playing truant and running over to the Marches\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThe good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is right, and that I\u2019ve been coddling the fellow as if I\u2019d been his grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can\u2019t get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat good times they had, to be sure. Such plays and tableaux, such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her heart\u2019s content, and Laurie played \u2018lord of the manor\u2019 in the most delightful style.\r\n\r\nBut Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up courage to go to the \u2018Mansion of Bliss\u2019, as Meg called it. She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \u201cHey!\u201d so loud, that he frightened her so much her \u2018feet chattered on the floor\u2019, she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence\u2019s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie\u2019s lessons and teachers. And presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March...\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy neglects his music now, and I\u2019m glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn\u2019t some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma\u2019am?\u201d\r\n\r\nBeth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile...\r\n\r\n\u201cThey needn\u2019t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I\u2019m shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. \u201cPlease, tell the young ladies what I say, and if they don\u2019t care to come, why, never mind.\u201d Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...\r\n\r\n\u201cOh sir, they do care, very very much!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you the musical girl?\u201d he asked, without any startling \u201cHey!\u201d as he looked down at her very kindly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Beth. I love it dearly, and I\u2019ll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,\u201d she added, fearing to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so come and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow kind you are, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\nBeth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear! Good day, madam.\u201d And away he went, in a great hurry.\r\n\r\nBeth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home. How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some pretty, easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved friend.\r\n\r\nShe stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked. She never saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what isn\u2019t always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped. Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her. At any rate she deserved both.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother, I\u2019m going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don\u2019t know any other way. Can I do it?\u201d asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making up,\u201d replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth\u2019s requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself.\r\n\r\nAfter many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needlewoman, and they were finished before anyone got tired of them. Then she wrote a short, simple note, and with Laurie\u2019s help, got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.\r\n\r\nWhen this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her, several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Beth, he\u2019s sent you...\u201d began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.\r\n\r\nBeth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all pointing and all saying at once, \u201cLook there! Look there!\u201d Beth did look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed like a sign board to \u201cMiss Elizabeth March.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor me?\u201d gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, all for you, my precious! Isn\u2019t it splendid of him? Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s the dearest old man in the world? Here\u2019s the key in the letter. We didn\u2019t open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\u201d cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou read it! I can\u2019t, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!\u201d and Beth hid her face in Jo\u2019s apron, quite upset by her present.\r\n\r\nJo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw were...\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss March: \u201cDear Madam\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow nice it sounds! I wish someone would write to me so!\u201d said Amy, who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any that suited me so well as yours,\u2019\u201d continues Jo. \u201c\u2018Heart\u2019s-ease is my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver. I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow \u2018the old gentleman\u2019 to send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he lost. With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain \u201c\u2018Your grateful friend and humble servant, \u2018JAMES LAURENCE\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, Beth, that\u2019s an honor to be proud of, I\u2019m sure! Laurie told me how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept all her little things carefully. Just think, he\u2019s given you her piano. That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\u201d said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and stool, all complete,\u201d added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying its beauties.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Your humble servant, James Laurence\u2019. Only think of his writing that to you. I\u2019ll tell the girls. They\u2019ll think it\u2019s splendid,\u201d said Amy, much impressed by the note.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry it, honey. Let\u2019s hear the sound of the baby pianny,\u201d said Hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.\r\n\r\nSo Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go and thank him,\u201d said Jo, by way of a joke, for the idea of the child\u2019s really going never entered her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I mean to. I guess I\u2019ll go now, before I get frightened thinking about it.\u201d And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the Laurences\u2019 door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I wish I may die if it ain\u2019t the queerest thing I ever see! The pianny has turned her head! She\u2019d never have gone in her right mind,\u201d cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle.\r\n\r\nThey would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice called out, \u201ccome in!\u201d she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, \u201cI came to thank you, sir, for...\u201d But she didn\u2019t finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed him.\r\n\r\nIf the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman wouldn\u2019t have been more astonished. But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly! And was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude can conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.\r\n\r\nWhen the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, \u201cWell, I do believe the world is coming to an end.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\nAMY\u2019S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION\r\n\r\n\u201cThat boy is a perfect cyclops, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Amy one day, as Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you say so, when he\u2019s got both his eyes? And very handsome ones they are, too,\u201d cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about her friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about his eyes, and I don\u2019t see why you need fire up when I admire his riding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she called him a Cyclops,\u201d exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t be so rude, it\u2019s only a \u2018lapse of lingy\u2019, as Mr. Davis says,\u201d retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. \u201cI just wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,\u201d she added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy\u2019s second blunder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI need it so much. I\u2019m dreadfully in debt, and it won\u2019t be my turn to have the rag money for a month.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn debt, Amy? What do you mean?\u201d And Meg looked sober.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can\u2019t pay them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls.\u201d And Meg tried to keep her countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to be thought mean, you must do it too. It\u2019s nothing but limes now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime. If she\u2019s mad with her, she eats one before her face, and doesn\u2019t offer even a suck. They treat by turns, and I\u2019ve had ever so many but haven\u2019t returned them, and I ought for they are debts of honor, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow much will pay them off and restore your credit?\u201d asked Meg, taking out her purse.\r\n\r\n\u201cA quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat for you. Don\u2019t you like limes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot much. You may have my share. Here\u2019s the money. Make it last as long as you can, for it isn\u2019t very plenty, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket money! I\u2019ll have a grand feast, for I haven\u2019t tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate about taking any, as I couldn\u2019t return them, and I\u2019m actually suffering for one.\u201d\r\n\r\nNext day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk. During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to treat circulated through her \u2018set\u2019, and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the spot. Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess, and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow\u2019s cutting remarks about \u2018some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other people\u2019s limes, and stuck-up people who were not too proud to ask for them\u2019, and she instantly crushed \u2018that Snow girl\u2019s\u2019 hopes by the withering telegram, \u201cYou needn\u2019t be so polite all of a sudden, for you won\u2019t get any.\u201d\r\n\r\nA distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and Amy\u2019s beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! Pride goes before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success. No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals, feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved. Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language of a schoolgirl, \u201cHe was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear\u201d. The word \u2018limes\u2019 was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung ladies, attention, if you please!\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss March, come to the desk.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.\r\n\r\n\u201cBring with you the limes you have in your desk,\u201d was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take all.\u201d whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence of mind.\r\n\r\nAmy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust added to his wrath.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d stammered Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cBring the rest immediately.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure there are no more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never lie, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them out of the window.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips. Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times, and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This\u2014this was too much. All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.\r\n\r\nAs Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \u201cHem!\u201d and said, in his most impressive manner...\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I never break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter. She was rather a favorite with \u2018old Davis\u2019, as, of course, he was called, and it\u2019s my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit\u2019s fate.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour hand, Miss March!\u201d was the only answer her mute appeal received, and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no difference to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck, and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will now stand on the platform till recess,\u201d said Mr. Davis, resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.\r\n\r\nThat was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break her heart with crying. A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her before. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought, \u201cI shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last, and the word \u2018Recess!\u2019 had never seemed so welcome to her before.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can go, Miss March,\u201d said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt, uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHe did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched her things, and left the place \u201cforever,\u201d as she passionately declared to herself. She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at once. Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and Hannah shook her fist at the \u2018villain\u2019 and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle.\r\n\r\nNo notice was taken of Amy\u2019s flight, except by her mates, but the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and delivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy\u2019s property, and departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a little every day with Beth,\u201d said Mrs. March that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr. Davis\u2019s manner of teaching and don\u2019t think the girls you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father\u2019s advice before I send you anywhere else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old school. It\u2019s perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\u201d sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved some punishment for disobedience,\u201d was the severe reply, which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\u201d cried Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\u201d replied her mother, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure that it won\u2019t do you more good than a bolder method. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite time you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is!\u201d cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. \u201cI knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she didn\u2019t know it, never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn\u2019t have believed it if anyone had told her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d known that nice girl. Maybe she would have helped me, I\u2019m so stupid,\u201d said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,\u201d answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\r\n\r\nJo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, \u201cIs Laurie an accomplished boy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,\u201d replied her mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he isn\u2019t conceited, is he?\u201d asked Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least. That is why he is so charming and we all like him so much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. It\u2019s nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to show off or get perked up,\u201d said Amy thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese things are always seen and felt in a person\u2019s manner and conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display them,\u201d said Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny more than it\u2019s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once, that folks may know you\u2019ve got them,\u201d added Jo, and the lecture ended in a laugh.\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\nJO MEETS APOLLYON\r\n\r\n\u201cGirls, where are you going?\u201d asked Amy, coming into their room one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind. Little girls shouldn\u2019t ask questions,\u201d returned Jo sharply.\r\n\r\nNow if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young, it is to be told that, and to be bidden to \u201crun away, dear\u201d is still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \u201cDo tell me! I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven\u2019t got anything to do, and am so lonely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t, dear, because you aren\u2019t invited,\u201d began Meg, but Jo broke in impatiently, \u201cNow, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all. You can\u2019t go, Amy, so don\u2019t be a baby and whine about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you stopped when I came in. Aren\u2019t you going with him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we are. Now do be still, and stop bothering.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know! I know! You\u2019re going to the theater to see the Seven Castles!\u201d she cried, adding resolutely, \u201cand I shall go, for Mother said I might see it, and I\u2019ve got my rag money, and it was mean not to tell me in time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust listen to me a minute, and be a good child,\u201d said Meg soothingly. \u201cMother doesn\u2019t wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let me. I\u2019ve been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I\u2019m dying for some fun. Do, Meg! I\u2019ll be ever so good,\u201d pleaded Amy, looking as pathetic as she could.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose we take her. I don\u2019t believe Mother would mind, if we bundle her up well,\u201d began Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she goes I shan\u2019t, and if I don\u2019t, Laurie won\u2019t like it, and it will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I should think she\u2019d hate to poke herself where she isn\u2019t wanted,\u201d said Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself.\r\n\r\nHer tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying, in her most aggravating way, \u201cI shall go. Meg says I may, and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn\u2019t anything to do with it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn\u2019t sit alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our pleasure. Or he\u2019ll get another seat for you, and that isn\u2019t proper when you weren\u2019t asked. You shan\u2019t stir a step, so you may just stay where you are,\u201d scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger in her hurry.\r\n\r\nSitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls hurried down, leaving their sister wailing. For now and then she forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child. Just as the party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone, \u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFiddlesticks!\u201d returned Jo, slamming the door.\r\n\r\nThey had a charming time, for The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and princesses, Jo\u2019s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it. The fairy queen\u2019s yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her \u2018sorry for it\u2019. She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble. Her anger never lasted long, and having humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, or asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play. On going up to put away her best hat, Jo\u2019s first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had soothed her feelings by turning Jo\u2019s top drawer upside down on the floor. Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.\r\n\r\nThere Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding breathlessly, \u201cHas anyone taken my book?\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg and Beth said, \u201cNo.\u201d at once, and looked surprised. Amy poked the fire and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmy, you\u2019ve got it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know where it is, then!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fib!\u201d cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t got it, don\u2019t know where it is now, and don\u2019t care.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know something about it, and you\u2019d better tell at once, or I\u2019ll make you.\u201d And Jo gave her a slight shake.\r\n\r\n\u201cScold as much as you like, you\u2019ll never see your silly old book again,\u201d cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI burned it up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to finish before Father got home? Have you really burned it?\u201d said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy nervously.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I did! I told you I\u2019d make you pay for being so cross yesterday, and I have, so...\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy got no farther, for Jo\u2019s hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of grief and anger...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I\u2019ll never forgive you as long as I live.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister\u2019s ear, she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.\r\n\r\nThe storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister. Jo\u2019s book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to print. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the old manuscript, so that Amy\u2019s bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her. Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her pet. Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them.\r\n\r\nWhen the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all Amy\u2019s courage to say meekly...\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease forgive me, Jo. I\u2019m very, very sorry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never shall forgive you,\u201d was Jo\u2019s stern answer, and from that moment she ignored Amy entirely.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted, and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own generous nature, softened Jo\u2019s resentment and healed the breach. It was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed. They felt this most when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone. But in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.\r\n\r\nAs Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, \u201cMy dear, don\u2019t let the sun go down upon your anger. Forgive each other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn\u2019t quite forgive yet. So she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was listening, \u201cIt was an abominable thing, and she doesn\u2019t deserve to be forgiven.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night.\r\n\r\nAmy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder cloud, and nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning, she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldn\u2019t even try when other people set them a virtuous example.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverybody is so hateful, I\u2019ll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,\u201d said Jo to herself, and off she went.\r\n\r\nAmy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient exclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere! She promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we shall have. But it\u2019s no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book, but I think she might do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,\u201d said Meg. \u201cGo after them. Don\u2019t say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, than take a quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be friends again with all her heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over the hill.\r\n\r\nIt was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back. Laurie did not see, for he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go on to the first bend, and see if it\u2019s all right before we begin to race,\u201d Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.\r\n\r\nJo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister\u2019s troubles. She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend, he shouted back...\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep near the shore. It isn\u2019t safe in the middle.\u201d Jo heard, but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...\r\n\r\n\u201cNo matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo\u2019s heart stand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone. She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie\u2019s voice cried out...\r\n\r\n\u201cBring a rail. Quick, quick!\u201d\r\n\r\nHow she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed, and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more frightened than hurt.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, we must walk her home as fast as we can. Pile our things on her, while I get off these confounded skates,\u201d cried Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before.\r\n\r\nShivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure she is safe?\u201d whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite safe, dear. She is not hurt, and won\u2019t even take cold, I think, you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,\u201d replied her mother cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cLaurie did it all. I only let her go. Mother, if she should die, it would be my fault.\u201d And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my dreadful temper! I try to cure it, I think I have, and then it breaks out worse than ever. Oh, Mother, what shall I do? What shall I do?\u201d cried poor Jo, in despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cWatch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault,\u201d said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo cried even harder.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could do anything when I\u2019m in a passion. I get so savage, I could hurt anyone and enjoy it. I\u2019m afraid I shall do something dreadful some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help me, do help me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, my child, I will. Don\u2019t cry so bitterly, but remember this day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYours, Mother? Why, you are never angry!\u201d And for the moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years to do so.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof. She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her. The knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it, made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it, though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?\u201d asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked,\u201d answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo\u2019s disheveled hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me, for the sharp words fly out before I know what I\u2019m about, and the more I say the worse I get, till it\u2019s a pleasure to hurt people\u2019s feelings and say dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy good mother used to help me...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you do us...\u201d interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor Mother! What helped you then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father, Jo. He never loses patience, never doubts or complains, but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me, and showed me that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier to try for your sakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done, and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them copy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mother, if I\u2019m ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,\u201d cried Jo, much touched.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch over your \u2018bosom enemy\u2019, as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not spoil your life. You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will try, Mother, I truly will. But you must help me, remind me, and keep me from flying out. I used to see Father sometimes put his finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face, and you always folded your lips tight and went away. Was he reminding you then?\u201d asked Jo softly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo saw that her mother\u2019s eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously, \u201cWas it wrong to watch you and to speak of it? I didn\u2019t mean to be rude, but it\u2019s so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so safe and happy here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much I love them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d grieved you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet you told him to go, Mother, and didn\u2019t cry when he went, and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,\u201d said Jo, wondering.\r\n\r\n\u201cI gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don\u2019t seem to need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to comfort and sustain me. My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of lifelong peace, happiness, and strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words. For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother\u2019s hand, she had drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.\r\n\r\nAmy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before.\r\n\r\n\u201cI let the sun go down on my anger. I wouldn\u2019t forgive her, and today, if it hadn\u2019t been for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I be so wicked?\u201d said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.\r\n\r\nAs if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a smile that went straight to Jo\u2019s heart. Neither said a word, but they hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\nMEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR\r\n\r\n\u201cI do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now,\u201d said Meg, one April day, as she stood packing the \u2018go abroady\u2019 trunk in her room, surrounded by her sisters.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,\u201d replied Jo, looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd such lovely weather, I\u2019m so glad of that,\u201d added Beth, tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great occasion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things,\u201d said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically replenished her sister\u2019s cushion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you were all going, but as you can\u2019t, I shall keep my adventures to tell you when I come back. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the least I can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get ready,\u201d said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did Mother give you out of the treasure box?\u201d asked Amy, who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when the proper time came.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue sash. I wanted the violet silk, but there isn\u2019t time to make it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlaton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it off beautifully. I wish I hadn\u2019t smashed my coral bracelet, for you might have had it,\u201d said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want,\u201d replied Meg. \u201cNow, let me see, there\u2019s my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn\u2019t it? The violet silk would be so nice. Oh, dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind, you\u2019ve got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always look like an angel in white,\u201d said Amy, brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t low-necked, and it doesn\u2019t sweep enough, but it will have to do. My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that I feel as if I\u2019d got a new one. My silk sacque isn\u2019t a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn\u2019t look like Sallie\u2019s. I didn\u2019t like to say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle. It\u2019s strong and neat, so I ought not to complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie\u2019s silk one with a gold top,\u201d sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor.\r\n\r\n\u201cChange it,\u201d advised Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be so silly, or hurt Marmee\u2019s feelings, when she took so much pains to get my things. It\u2019s a nonsensical notion of mine, and I\u2019m not going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common.\u201d And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnnie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put some on mine?\u201d she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins, fresh from Hannah\u2019s hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t, for the smart caps won\u2019t match the plain gowns without any trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn\u2019t rig,\u201d said Jo decidedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?\u201d said Meg impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou said the other day that you\u2019d be perfectly happy if you could only go to Annie Moffat\u2019s,\u201d observed Beth in her quiet way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I did! Well, I am happy, and I won\u2019t fret, but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn\u2019t it? There now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for Mother to pack,\u201d said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton, which she called her \u2018ball dress\u2019 with an important air.\r\n\r\nThe next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented than she went. But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life.\r\n\r\nThe Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted, at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases, crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well as she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat\u2019s pretty things, the more she envied her and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings.\r\n\r\nShe had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls were busily employed in \u2018having a good time\u2019. They shopped, walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought. Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done. Everyone petted her, and \u2018Daisey\u2019, as they called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin wouldn\u2019t do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed. So out came the tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie\u2019s crisp new one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud. No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms. But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are altogether ravishing,\u201d cried Annie, with a great sniff.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are for Miss March, the man said. And here\u2019s a note,\u201d put in the maid, holding it to Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat fun! Who are they from? Didn\u2019t know you had a lover,\u201d cried the girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,\u201d said Meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty.\r\n\r\nFeeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was \u2018the sweetest little thing she ever saw\u2019, and they looked quite charmed with her small attention. Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didn\u2019t strike her as so very shabby now.\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her heart\u2019s content. Everyone was very kind, and she had three compliments. Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice. Major Lincoln asked who \u2018the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes\u2019 was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her because she \u2018didn\u2019t dawdle, but had some spring in her\u2019, as he gracefully expressed it. So altogether she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall...\r\n\r\n\u201cHow old is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSixteen or seventeen, I should say,\u201d replied another voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn\u2019t it? Sallie says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well, early as it is. The girl evidently doesn\u2019t think of it yet,\u201d said Mrs. Moffat.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily. Poor thing! She\u2019d be so nice if she was only got up in style. Do you think she\u2019d be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?\u201d asked another voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s proud, but I don\u2019t believe she\u2019d mind, for that dowdy tarlaton is all she has got. She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere Meg\u2019s partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated. She was proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had just heard. For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, \u201cMrs. M. has made her plans,\u201d \u201cthat fib about her mamma,\u201d and \u201cdowdy tarlaton,\u201d till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard. Her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man\u2019s daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.\r\n\r\nPoor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her friends struck Meg at once. They treated her with more respect, she thought, took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...\r\n\r\n\u201cDaisy, dear, I\u2019ve sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for Thursday. We should like to know him, and it\u2019s only a proper compliment to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely, \u201cYou are very kind, but I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not, Cherie?\u201d asked Miss Belle.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s too old.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!\u201d cried Miss Clara.\r\n\r\n\u201cNearly seventy, I believe,\u201d answered Meg, counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou sly creature! Of course we meant the young man,\u201d exclaimed Miss Belle, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any, Laurie is only a little boy.\u201d And Meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout your age,\u201d Nan said.\r\n\r\n\u201cNearer my sister Jo\u2019s; I am seventeen in August,\u201d returned Meg, tossing her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nice of him to send you flowers, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Annie, looking wise about nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are so fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know, so it is quite natural that we children should play together,\u201d and Meg hoped they would say no more.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s evident Daisy isn\u2019t out yet,\u201d said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite a pastoral state of innocence all round,\u201d returned Miss Belle with a shrug.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going out to get some little matters for my girls. Can I do anything for you, young ladies?\u201d asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Sallie. \u201cI\u2019ve got my new pink silk for Thursday and don\u2019t want a thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I...\u201d began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall you wear?\u201d asked Sallie.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly torn last night,\u201d said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you send home for another?\u201d said Sallie, who was not an observing young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any other.\u201d It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, \u201cOnly that? How funny...\u201d She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly...\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn\u2019t out yet? There\u2019s no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen, for I\u2019ve got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I\u2019ve outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won\u2019t you, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are very kind, but I don\u2019t mind my old dress if you don\u2019t, it does well enough for a little girl like me,\u201d said Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do it, and you\u2019d be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there. I shan\u2019t let anyone see you till you are done, and then we\u2019ll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,\u201d said Belle in her persuasive tone.\r\n\r\nMeg couldn\u2019t refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she would be \u2018a little beauty\u2019 after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense would have added \u2018a soupcon of rouge\u2019, if Meg had not rebelled. They laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.\r\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?\u201d cried Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome and show yourself,\u201d said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room where the others were waiting.\r\n\r\nAs Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that she was \u2018a little beauty\u2019. Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like a party of magpies.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head, Clara, and don\u2019t any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,\u201d said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I\u2019m nowhere beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you\u2019re quite French, I assure you. Let your flowers hang, don\u2019t be so careful of them, and be sure you don\u2019t trip,\u201d returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was prettier than herself.\r\n\r\nKeeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her before, were very affectionate all of a sudden. Several young gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air of interest. She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...\r\n\r\n\u201cDaisy March\u2014father a colonel in the army\u2014one of our first families, but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d said the old lady, putting up her glass for another observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat\u2019s fibs. The \u2018queer feeling\u2019 did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused, for just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.\r\n\r\n\u201cSilly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head. I won\u2019t care for it, or let it change me a bit,\u201d thought Meg, and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d she said, with her most grown-up air.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,\u201d answered Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her maternal tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall you tell her?\u201d asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall say I didn\u2019t know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike yourself, I\u2019m quite afraid of you,\u201d he said, fumbling at his glove button.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like it. Wouldn\u2019t Jo stare if she saw me?\u201d said Meg, bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I think she would,\u201d returned Laurie gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like me so?\u201d asked Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d was the blunt reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d in an anxious tone.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer, which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like fuss and feathers.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg walked away, saying petulantly, \u201cYou are the rudest boy I ever saw.\u201d\r\n\r\nFeeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother...\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are making a fool of that little girl. I wanted you to see her, but they have spoiled her entirely. She\u2019s nothing but a doll tonight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear!\u201d sighed Meg. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been sensible and worn my own things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said, with his very best bow and his hand out...\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,\u201d said Meg, trying to look offended and failing entirely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it, I\u2019m dying to do it. Come, I\u2019ll be good. I don\u2019t like your gown, but I do think you are just splendid.\u201d And he waved his hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.\r\n\r\nMeg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time, \u201cTake care my skirt doesn\u2019t trip you up. It\u2019s the plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,\u201d said Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.\r\n\r\nAway they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home, they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff.\r\n\r\n\u201cLaurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?\u201d said Meg, as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she would not own why.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t I!\u201d said Laurie, with alacrity.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won\u2019t understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why did you do it?\u201d said Laurie\u2019s eyes, so plainly that Meg hastily added...\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall tell them myself all about it, and \u2018fess\u2019 to Mother how silly I\u2019ve been. But I\u2019d rather do it myself. So you\u2019ll not tell, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI give you my word I won\u2019t, only what shall I say when they ask me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other? You don\u2019t look as if you were having a good time. Are you?\u201d And Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper...\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not just now. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m horrid. I only wanted a little fun, but this sort doesn\u2019t pay, I find, and I\u2019m getting tired of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere comes Ned Moffat. What does he want?\u201d said Laurie, knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he\u2019s coming for them. What a bore!\u201d said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused Laurie immensely.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving \u2018like a pair of fools\u2019, as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that. I wouldn\u2019t, Meg, your mother doesn\u2019t like it, you know,\u201d he whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not Meg tonight, I\u2019m \u2018a doll\u2019 who does all sorts of crazy things. Tomorrow I shall put away my \u2018fuss and feathers\u2019 and be desperately good again,\u201d she answered with an affected little laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cWish tomorrow was here, then,\u201d muttered Laurie, walking off, ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.\r\n\r\nMeg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did. After supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say good night.\r\n\r\n\u201cRemember!\u201d she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had already begun.\r\n\r\n\u201cSilence a la mort,\u201d replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as he went away.\r\n\r\nThis little bit of byplay excited Annie\u2019s curiosity, but Meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadn\u2019t enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her fortnight\u2019s fun and feeling that she had \u2018sat in the lap of luxury\u2019 long enough.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all the time. Home is a nice place, though it isn\u2019t splendid,\u201d said Meg, looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,\u201d replied her mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day. For motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children\u2019s faces.\r\n\r\nMeg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried. As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her chair and, taking Beth\u2019s stool, leaned her elbows on her mother\u2019s knee, saying bravely...\r\n\r\n\u201cMarmee, I want to \u2018fess\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought so. What is it, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I go away?\u201d asked Jo discreetly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not. Don\u2019t I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are prepared,\u201d said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little anxious.\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you they dressed me up, but I didn\u2019t tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie thought I wasn\u2019t proper. I know he did, though he didn\u2019t say so, and one man called me \u2018a doll\u2019. I knew it was silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether abominable,\u201d said Meg self-reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something more, I think.\u201d And Mrs. March smoothed the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have people say and think such things about us and Laurie.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats\u2019, and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg\u2019s innocent mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if that isn\u2019t the greatest rubbish I ever heard,\u201d cried Jo indignantly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you pop out and tell them so on the spot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn\u2019t help hearing at first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn\u2019t remember that I ought to go away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I\u2019ll show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having \u2018plans\u2019 and being kind to Laurie because he\u2019s rich and may marry us by-and-by! Won\u2019t he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?\u201d And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you tell Laurie, I\u2019ll never forgive you! She mustn\u2019t, must she, Mother?\u201d said Meg, looking distressed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you can,\u201d said Mrs. March gravely. \u201cI was very unwise to let you go among people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you, Meg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, I won\u2019t let it hurt me. I\u2019ll forget all the bad and remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very much for letting me go. I\u2019ll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, Mother. I know I\u2019m a silly little girl, and I\u2019ll stay with you till I\u2019m fit to take care of myself. But it is nice to be praised and admired, and I can\u2019t help saying I like it,\u201d said Meg, looking half ashamed of the confession.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg.\u201d\r\n\r\nMargaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and things of that sort. And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother, do you have \u2018plans\u2019, as Mrs. Moffat said?\u201d asked Meg bashfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine differ somewhat from Mrs. Moffat\u2019s, I suspect. I will tell you some of them, for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but not too young to understand me, and mothers\u2019 lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in time, perhaps, so listen to my \u2018plans\u2019 and help me carry them out, if they are good.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her serious yet cheery way...\r\n\r\n\u201cI want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To be admired, loved, and respected. To have a happy youth, to be well and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience. It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the happy time comes, you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear girls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the world, marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid houses, which are not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious thing, and when well used, a noble thing, but I never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for. I\u2019d rather see you poor men\u2019s wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor girls don\u2019t stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put themselves forward,\u201d sighed Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll be old maids,\u201d said Jo stoutly.\r\n\r\n\u201cRight, Jo. Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands,\u201d said Mrs. March decidedly. \u201cDon\u2019t be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these things to time. Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are not. One thing remember, my girls. Mother is always ready to be your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort of our lives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will, Marmee, we will!\u201d cried both, with all their hearts, as she bade them good night.\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\nTHE P.C. AND P.O.\r\n\r\nAs spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts. The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, \u201cI\u2019d know which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see \u2019em in Chiny,\u201d and so she might, for the girls\u2019 tastes differed as much as their characters. Meg\u2019s had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it. Jo\u2019s bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying experiments. This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt Cockle-top and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned fragrant flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies. Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there.\r\n\r\nGardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some old, some new, all more or less original. One of these was the \u2018P.C.\u2019, for as secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one, and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the Pickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with a big \u2018P.C.\u2019 in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something, while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven o\u2019clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass, Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy, who was always trying to do what she couldn\u2019t, was Nathaniel Winkle. Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short comings. On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to read:\r\n\r\n\u201cTHE PICKWICK PORTFOLIO\u201d\r\n\r\nMAY 20, 18\u2014\r\n\r\nPOET\u2019S CORNER\r\n\r\nANNIVERSARY ODE\r\n\r\nAgain we meet to celebrate\r\n    With badge and solemn rite,\r\nOur fifty-second anniversary,\r\n    In Pickwick Hall, tonight.\r\n\r\nWe all are here in perfect health,\r\n    None gone from our small band:\r\nAgain we see each well-known face,\r\n    And press each friendly hand.\r\n\r\nOur Pickwick, always at his post,\r\n    With reverence we greet,\r\nAs, spectacles on nose, he reads\r\n    Our well-filled weekly sheet.\r\n\r\nAlthough he suffers from a cold,\r\n    We joy to hear him speak,\r\nFor words of wisdom from him fall,\r\n    In spite of croak or squeak.\r\n\r\nOld six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,\r\n    With elephantine grace,\r\nAnd beams upon the company,\r\n    With brown and jovial face.\r\n\r\nPoetic fire lights up his eye,\r\n    He struggles \u2019gainst his lot.\r\nBehold ambition on his brow,\r\n    And on his nose, a blot.\r\n\r\nNext our peaceful Tupman comes,\r\n    So rosy, plump, and sweet,\r\nWho chokes with laughter at the puns,\r\n    And tumbles off his seat.\r\n\r\nPrim little Winkle too is here,\r\n    With every hair in place,\r\nA model of propriety,\r\n    Though he hates to wash his face.\r\n\r\nThe year is gone, we still unite\r\n    To joke and laugh and read,\r\nAnd tread the path of literature\r\n    That doth to glory lead.\r\n\r\nLong may our paper prosper well,\r\n    Our club unbroken be,\r\nAnd coming years their blessings pour\r\n    On the useful, gay \u2018P. C.\u2019.\r\n\r\nA. SNODGRASS\r\n\r\nTHE MASKED MARRIAGE\r\n(A Tale Of Venice)\r\n\r\nGondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance. Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on. \u201cHas your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight?\u201d asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her stern father bestows her hand,\u201d returned the troubadour.\r\n\r\n\u201cTis whispered that she loves the young English artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old Count,\u201d said the lady, as they joined the dance. The revel was at its height when a priest appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove, hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait your services.\u201d All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over. Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding an explanation.\r\n\r\n\u201cGladly would I give it if I could, but I only know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my children, let the play end. Unmask and receive my blessing.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an English earl was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy lord, you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count Antonio. I can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady, now my wife.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe count stood like one changed to stone, and turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph, \u201cTo you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have by this masked marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\nS. PICKWICK\r\n\r\nWhy is the P. C. like the Tower of Babel?\r\nIt is full of unruly members.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF A SQUASH\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden, and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many squashes. One day in October, when they were ripe, he picked one and took it to market. A grocerman bought and put it in his shop. That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went and bought it for her mother. She lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it with salt and butter, for dinner. And to the rest she added a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg, and some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it till it was brown and nice, and next day it was eaten by a family named March.\r\n\r\nT. TUPMAN\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, Sir:\u2014\r\n    I address you upon the subject of sin the sinner I mean is a man named Winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and sometimes won\u2019t write his piece in this fine paper I hope you will pardon his badness and let him send a French fable because he can\u2019t write out of his head as he has so many lessons to do and no brains in future I will try to take time by the fetlock and prepare some work which will be all commy la fo that means all right I am in haste as it is nearly school time.\r\n\r\nYours respectably,\r\nN. WINKLE\r\n\r\n[The above is a manly and handsome acknowledgment of past misdemeanors. If our young friend studied punctuation, it would be well.]\r\n\r\nA SAD ACCIDENT\r\n\r\nOn Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock in our basement, followed by cries of distress. On rushing in a body to the cellar, we discovered our beloved President prostrate upon the floor, having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes. A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water, upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and torn his garments badly. On being removed from this perilous situation, it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add, is now doing well.\r\n\r\nED.\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT\r\n\r\nIt is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs. Snowball Pat Paw. This lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends; for her beauty attracted all eyes, her graces and virtues endeared her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community.\r\n    When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching the butcher\u2019s cart, and it is feared that some villain, tempted by her charms, basely stole her. Weeks have passed, but no trace of her has been discovered, and we relinquish all hope, tie a black ribbon to her basket, set aside her dish, and weep for her as one lost to us forever.\r\n\r\nA sympathizing friend sends the following gem:\r\n\r\nA LAMENT\r\nFOR S. B. PAT PAW\r\n\r\nWe mourn the loss of our little pet,\r\n    And sigh o\u2019er her hapless fate,\r\nFor never more by the fire she\u2019ll sit,\r\n    Nor play by the old green gate.\r\n\r\nThe little grave where her infant sleeps\r\n    Is \u2019neath the chestnut tree.\r\nBut o\u2019er her grave we may not weep,\r\n    We know not where it may be.\r\n\r\nHer empty bed, her idle ball,\r\n    Will never see her more;\r\nNo gentle tap, no loving purr\r\n    Is heard at the parlor door.\r\n\r\nAnother cat comes after her mice,\r\n    A cat with a dirty face,\r\nBut she does not hunt as our darling did,\r\n    Nor play with her airy grace.\r\n\r\nHer stealthy paws tread the very hall\r\n    Where Snowball used to play,\r\nBut she only spits at the dogs our pet\r\n    So gallantly drove away.\r\n\r\nShe is useful and mild, and does her best,\r\n    But she is not fair to see,\r\nAnd we cannot give her your place dear,\r\n    Nor worship her as we worship thee.\r\n\r\nA.S.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENTS\r\n\r\nMISS ORANTHY BLUGGAGE, the accomplished strong-minded lecturer, will deliver her famous lecture on \u201cWOMAN AND HER POSITION\u201d at Pickwick Hall, next Saturday Evening, after the usual performances.\r\n\r\nA WEEKLY MEETING will be held at Kitchen Place, to teach young ladies how to cook.

I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C. Come now, do have him.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll put it to a vote,\u201d said the President. \u201cAll in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying, \u2018Aye\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\nA loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody\u2019s surprise, by a timid one from Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cContrary-minded say, \u2018No\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say with great elegance, \u201cWe don\u2019t wish any boys, they only joke and bounce about. This is a ladies\u2019 club, and we wish to be private and proper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,\u201d observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she always did when doubtful.\r\n\r\nUp rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. \u201cSir, I give you my word as a gentleman, Laurie won\u2019t do anything of the sort. He likes to write, and he\u2019ll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental, don\u2019t you see? We can do so little for him, and he does so much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid. I say he may come, and his grandpa, too, if he likes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly. \u201cNow then, vote again. Everybody remember it\u2019s our Laurie, and say, \u2018Aye!\u2019\u201d cried Snodgrass excitedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAye! Aye! Aye!\u201d replied three voices at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! Bless you! Now, as there\u2019s nothing like \u2018taking time by the fetlock\u2019, as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present the new member.\u201d And, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou rogue! You traitor! Jo, how could you?\u201d cried the three girls, as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe coolness of you two rascals is amazing,\u201d began Mr. Pickwick, trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile. But the new member was equal to the occasion, and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most engaging manner, \u201cMr. President and ladies\u2014I beg pardon, gentlemen\u2014allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble servant of the club.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! Good!\u201d cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy faithful friend and noble patron,\u201d continued Laurie with a wave of the hand, \u201cwho has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight. I planned it, and she only gave in after lots of teasing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now, don\u2019t lay it all on yourself. You know I proposed the cupboard,\u201d broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind what she says. I\u2019m the wretch that did it, sir,\u201d said the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. \u201cBut on my honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHear! Hear!\u201d cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on, go on!\u201d added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed benignly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I may be allowed the expression. It\u2019s the old martin house, but I\u2019ve stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts of things, and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it will be uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key, and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.\u201d\r\n\r\nGreat applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time before order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best. So it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.\r\n\r\nNo one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted, well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did add \u2018spirit\u2019 to the meetings, and \u2018a tone\u2019 to the paper, for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental. Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.\r\n\r\nThe P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, scoldings, and puppies. The old gentleman liked the fun, and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah\u2019s charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo\u2019s care. How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come.\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\nEXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and I\u2019m free. Three months\u2019 vacation\u2014how I shall enjoy it!\u201d exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.\r\n\r\n\u201cAunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!\u201d said Jo. \u201cI was mortally afraid she\u2019d ask me to go with her. If she had, I should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard, you know, and I\u2019d rather be excused. We had a flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she\u2019d find it impossible to part from me. I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, \u2018Josyphine, won\u2019t you\u2014?\u2019 I didn\u2019t hear any more, for I basely turned and fled. I did actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor old Jo! She came in looking as if bears were after her,\u201d said Beth, as she cuddled her sister\u2019s feet with a motherly air.\r\n\r\n\u201cAunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?\u201d observed Amy, tasting her mixture critically.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s too warm to be particular about one\u2019s parts of speech,\u201d murmured Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall you do all your vacation?\u201d asked Amy, changing the subject with tact.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall lie abed late, and do nothing,\u201d replied Meg, from the depths of the rocking chair. \u201cI\u2019ve been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people, so now I\u2019m going to rest and revel to my heart\u2019s content.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Jo, \u201cthat dozy way wouldn\u2019t suit me. I\u2019ve laid in a heap of books, and I\u2019m going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree, when I\u2019m not having l\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018larks!\u2019\u201d implored Amy, as a return snub for the \u2018samphire\u2019 correction.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say \u2018nightingales\u2019 then, with Laurie. That\u2019s proper and appropriate, since he\u2019s a warbler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time and rest, as the girls mean to,\u201d proposed Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I will, if Mother doesn\u2019t mind. I want to learn some new songs, and my children need fitting up for the summer. They are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay we, Mother?\u201d asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in what they called \u2018Marmee\u2019s corner\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it. I think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear, no! It will be delicious, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Meg complacently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI now propose a toast, as my \u2018friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp\u2019, says. Fun forever, and no grubbing!\u201d cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the lemonade went round.\r\n\r\nThey all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day. Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o\u2019clock. Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy\u2019s books lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but \u2018Marmee\u2019s corner\u2019, which looked as usual. And there Meg sat, to \u2018rest and read\u2019, which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide, Wide World, up in the apple tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.\r\n\r\nAt teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in the afternoon and got a \u2018sweet blue muslin\u2019, had discovered, after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn\u2019t wash, which mishap made her slightly cross. Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy Brown\u2019s party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she had \u2018nothing to wear\u2019. But these were mere trifles, and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said nothing, and with Hannah\u2019s help did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the \u2018resting and reveling\u2019 process. The days kept getting longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury, Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily, that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell back into her old ways now and then. But something in the air affected her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she was \u2018a fright\u2019. Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were small, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden. She didn\u2019t like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn\u2019t draw all the time. Tea parties didn\u2019t amount to much, neither did picnics, unless very well conducted. \u201cIf one could have a fine house, full of nice girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz,\u201d complained Miss Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.\r\n\r\nNo one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.\r\n\r\nWhen they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen, no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy on us! What has happened?\u201d cried Jo, staring about her in dismay.\r\n\r\nMeg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother isn\u2019t sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can. It\u2019s a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn\u2019t act a bit like herself. But she says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn\u2019t grumble but take care of ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy enough, and I like the idea, I\u2019m aching for something to do, that is, some new amusement, you know,\u201d added Jo quickly.\r\n\r\nIn fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah\u2019s saying, \u201cHousekeeping ain\u2019t no joke.\u201d There was plenty of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think of her, for she\u2019d take care of herself,\u201d said Meg, who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot.\r\n\r\nSo a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the cook\u2019s compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo was gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor little souls, they will have a hard time, I\u2019m afraid, but they won\u2019t suffer, and it will do them good,\u201d she said, producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly little deception for which they were grateful.\r\n\r\nMany were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll get the dinner and be servant, you be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,\u201d said Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.\r\n\r\nThis obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting. Jo, with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to dinner.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better see what you have got before you think of having company,\u201d said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some asparagus and a lobster, \u2018for a relish\u2019, as Hannah says. We\u2019ll have lettuce and make a salad. I don\u2019t know how, but the book tells. I\u2019ll have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you want to be elegant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t try too many messes, Jo, for you can\u2019t make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat. I wash my hands of the dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own responsibility, you may just take care of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding. You\u2019ll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won\u2019t you?\u201d asked Jo, rather hurt.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t know much, except about bread and a few trifles. You had better ask Mother\u2019s leave before you order anything,\u201d returned Meg prudently.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I shall. I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d And Jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet what you like, and don\u2019t disturb me. I\u2019m going out to dinner and can\u2019t worry about things at home,\u201d said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to her. \u201cI never enjoyed housekeeping, and I\u2019m going to take a vacation today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything is out of sorts, somehow,\u201d she said to herself, going downstairs. \u201cThere\u2019s Beth crying, that\u2019s a sure sign that something is wrong in this family. If Amy is bothering, I\u2019ll shake her.\u201d\r\n\r\nFeeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for want of which he had died.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, I forgot him, there isn\u2019t a seed or a drop left. Oh, Pip! Oh, Pip! How could I be so cruel to you?\u201d cried Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.\r\n\r\nJo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a coffin.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,\u201d said Amy hopefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been starved, and he shan\u2019t be baked now he\u2019s dead. I\u2019ll make him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I\u2019ll never have another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,\u201d murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now, don\u2019t cry, Bethy. It\u2019s a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and lay him in my box, and after the dinner party, we\u2019ll have a nice little funeral,\u201d said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.\r\n\r\nLeaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when she discovered that the fire was out.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a sweet prospect!\u201d muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open, and poking vigorously among the cinders.\r\n\r\nHaving rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the water heated. The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid strawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure appeared, demanding tartly...\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, isn\u2019t bread \u2018riz\u2019 enough when it runs over the pans?\u201d\r\n\r\nSallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. A strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she\u2019d come to dinner. Now this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and had few friends. So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories of the people whom she knew.\r\n\r\nLanguage cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone, and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever. The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves. The potatoes had to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at the last. The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked, having been skilfully \u2018deaconed\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only it\u2019s mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,\u201d thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide.\r\n\r\nPoor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed, Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo\u2019s one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water hastily. Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, what is it?\u201d exclaimed Jo, trembling.\r\n\r\n\u201cSalt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,\u201d replied Meg with a tragic gesture.\r\n\r\nJo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator. She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when she met Laurie\u2019s eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts. The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did everyone else, even \u2018Croaker\u2019 as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober ourselves with a funeral,\u201d said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend\u2019s dinner table.\r\n\r\nThey did sober themselves for Beth\u2019s sake. Laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph, composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.\r\n\r\nHere lies Pip March,\r\nWho died the 7th of June;\r\nLoved and lamented sore,\r\nAnd not forgotten soon.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.\r\n\r\nLaurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs. March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment.\r\n\r\nBefore the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a scramble to get ready to see them. Then tea must be got, errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute. As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a dreadful day this has been!\u201d began Jo, usually the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,\u201d said Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit like home,\u201d added Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t seem so without Marmee and little Pip,\u201d sighed Beth, glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you want it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another week of it?\u201d she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d cried Jo decidedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I,\u201d echoed the others.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others, do you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLounging and larking doesn\u2019t pay,\u201d observed Jo, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose you learn plain cooking. That\u2019s a useful accomplishment, which no woman should be without,\u201d said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly at the recollection of Jo\u2019s dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we\u2019d get on?\u201d cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you got on pretty well, though I don\u2019t think you were very happy or amiable. So I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself. Don\u2019t you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do, Mother, we do!\u201d cried the girls.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for everyone. It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don\u2019t,\u201d said Jo. \u201cI\u2019ll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner party I have shall be a success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it, Marmee. I can and I will, though I\u2019m not fond of sewing. That will be better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as they are.\u201d said Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music and dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not playing,\u201d was Beth\u2019s resolution, while Amy followed their example by heroically declaring, \u201cI shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to my parts of speech.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good! Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it, only don\u2019t go to the other extreme and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work and play, make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite of poverty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll remember, Mother!\u201d and they did.\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\nCAMP LAURENCE\r\n\r\nBeth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail. One July day she came in with her hands full, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your posy, Mother! Laurie never forgets that,\u201d she said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \u2018Marmee\u2019s corner\u2019, and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\u201d continued Beth, delivering the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\u201d said Meg, looking at the gray cotton glove. \u201cDidn\u2019t you drop the other in the garden?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t, for there was only one in the office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted. I think Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn\u2019t Laurie\u2019s writing.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother\u2019s mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered the whole post office and stuck outside,\u201d said Beth, laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, \u2018Why mind the fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!\u2019 I said I would if I had one, and he has sent me this, to try me. I\u2019ll wear it for fun, and show him I don\u2019t care for the fashion.\u201d And hanging the antique broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.\r\n\r\nOne from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said to her...\r\n\r\nMy Dear:\r\n\r\nI write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook. I, too, have seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving...\r\n\r\nMother\r\n\r\n\u201cThat does me good! That\u2019s worth millions of money and pecks of praise. Oh, Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I have you to help me.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears, for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging, because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote...\r\n\r\nDear Jo, What ho!\r\n\r\nSome English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to have a jolly time. If it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m going to pitch my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet\u2014have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks. They are nice people, and like such things. Brooke will go to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls. I want you all to come, can\u2019t let Beth off at any price, and nobody shall worry her. Don\u2019t bother about rations, I\u2019ll see to that and everything else, only do come, there\u2019s a good fellow!\r\n\r\nIn a tearing hurry, Yours ever, Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s richness!\u201d cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course we can go, Mother? It will be such a help to Laurie, for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people. Do you know anything about them, Jo?\u201d asked Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. I fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn\u2019t admire Kate much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad my French print is clean, it\u2019s just the thing and so becoming!\u201d observed Meg complacently. \u201cHave you anything decent, Jo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cScarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and tramp about, so I don\u2019t want any starch to think of. You\u2019ll come, Betty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you won\u2019t let any boys talk to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI like to please Laurie, and I\u2019m not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so kind. But I don\u2019t want to play, or sing, or say anything. I\u2019ll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you\u2019ll take care of me, Jo, so I\u2019ll go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my good girl. You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love you for it. Fighting faults isn\u2019t easy, as I know, and a cheery word kind of gives a lift. Thank you, Mother,\u201d And Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,\u201d said Amy, showing her mail.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,\u201d added Beth, whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play tomorrow with free minds,\u201d said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a broom.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun peeped into the girls\u2019 room early next morning to promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature. It was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy\u2019s ornament.\r\n\r\nSunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a lively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters\u2019 toilets by frequent telegrams from the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock. I wish he would go too. There\u2019s Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy! Oh, mercy me! Here\u2019s a carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is lame, poor thing, he\u2019s got a crutch. Laurie didn\u2019t tell us that. Be quick, girls! It\u2019s getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare. Meg, isn\u2019t that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the mountains. There is Sallie. I\u2019m glad she got back in time. Am I all right, Jo?\u201d cried Meg in a flutter.\r\n\r\n\u201cA regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff. Now then, come on!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It\u2019s too absurd! You shall not make a guy of yourself,\u201d remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI just will, though, for it\u2019s capital, so shady, light, and big. It will make fun, and I don\u2019t mind being a guy if I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d With that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed, a bright little band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims.\r\n\r\nLaurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner. The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned\u2019s assurances that he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie \u2018primmed up his mouth\u2019 when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a standoff-don\u2019t-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not \u2018dreadful\u2019, but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends.\r\n\r\nTents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug. Jo\u2019s funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of general utility. It broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a shower came up, she said. Miss Kate decided that she was \u2018odd\u2019, but rather clever, and smiled upon her from afar.\r\n\r\nMeg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon \u2018skill and dexterity\u2019. Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge. He never talked to her much, but he looked at her a good deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume. He was not very wise, but very good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.\r\n\r\nIt was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet.\r\n\r\n\u201cWelcome to Camp Laurence!\u201d said the young host, as they landed with exclamations of delight.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the other fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. Now, let\u2019s have a game before it gets hot, and then we\u2019ll see about dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took Sallie, Jo, and Ned. The English played well, but the Americans played better, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of \u201976 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers. He gave a stroke, his ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was very near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m through! Now, Miss Jo, I\u2019ll settle you, and get in first,\u201d cried the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou pushed it. I saw you. It\u2019s my turn now,\u201d said Jo sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon my word, I didn\u2019t move it. It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is allowed. So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the stake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\u201d said Jo angrily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!\u201d returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.\r\n\r\nJo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time, colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side had nearly won, for Kate\u2019s ball was the last but one and lay near the stake.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy George, it\u2019s all up with us! Goodbye, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so you are finished,\u201d cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see the finish.\r\n\r\n\u201cYankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\u201d said Jo, with a look that made the lad redden, \u201cespecially when they beat them,\u201d she added, as, leaving Kate\u2019s ball untouched, she won the game by a clever stroke.\r\n\r\nLaurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn\u2019t do to exult over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend, \u201cGood for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him. We can\u2019t tell him so, but he won\u2019t do it again, take my word for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and said approvingly, \u201cIt was dreadfully provoking, but you kept your temper, and I\u2019m so glad, Jo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should certainly have boiled over if I hadn\u2019t stayed among the nettles till I got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. It\u2019s simmering now, so I hope he\u2019ll keep out of my way,\u201d returned Jo, biting her lips as she glowered at Fred from under her big hat.\r\n\r\n\u201cTime for lunch,\u201d said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch. \u201cCommissary general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good coffee?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJo can,\u201d said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates.\r\n\r\nThe commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green leaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s salt here,\u201d said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I prefer spiders,\u201d she replied, fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death. \u201cHow dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?\u201d added Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run short.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven\u2019t got over it yet. This is no credit to me, you know, I don\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s you and Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I\u2019m no end obliged to you. What shall we do when we can\u2019t eat anymore?\u201d asked Laurie, feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave games till it\u2019s cooler. I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss Kate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her. She\u2019s company, and you ought to stay with her more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you company too? I thought she\u2019d suit Brooke, but he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers. I\u2019m going, so you needn\u2019t try to preach propriety, for you can\u2019t do it, Jo.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing room to play Rig-marole.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when the next takes it up and does the same. It\u2019s very funny when well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over. Please start it, Mr. Brooke,\u201d said Kate, with a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman.\r\n\r\nLying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune, for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was very fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely, for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master, though he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to this pet of the king\u2019s, the knight rode him through the city, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine. At last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them. He went and knocked. The great door flew open, and he beheld...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, \u2018At last! At last!\u2019\u201d continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired the style. \u201c\u2019Tis she!\u2019 cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy. \u2018Oh, rise!\u2019 she said, extending a hand of marble fairness. \u2018Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you,\u2019 swore the knight, still kneeling. \u2018Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed.\u2019 \u2018Where is the villain?\u2019 \u2018In the mauve salon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.\u2019 \u2018I obey, and return victorious or dead!\u2019 With these thrilling words he rushed away, and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he received...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him,\u201d said Ned. \u201cInstantly, Sir What\u2019s-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March. At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and chilled his blood...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand,\u201d went on Meg. \u201cIt beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music. He sprang forward to enter, but the specter plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSnuffbox,\u201d said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the audience. \u201c\u2018Thankee,\u2019 said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. \u2018Ha! Ha!\u2019 laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all rose and began to...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDance a hornpipe,\u201d cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, \u201cand, as they danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail. \u2018Up with the jib, reef the tops\u2019l halliards, helm hard alee, and man the guns!\u2019 roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. \u2018Go in and win, my hearties!\u2019 says the captain, and a tremendous fight began. Of course the British beat\u2014they always do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t!\u201d cried Jo, aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers ran blood, for the order had been \u2018Cutlasses, and die hard!\u2019 \u2018Bosun\u2019s mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if he doesn\u2019t confess his sins double quick,\u2019 said the British captain. The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars cheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, \u2018To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea\u2019 where...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, gracious! What shall I say?\u201d cried Sallie, as Fred ended his rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books. \u201cWell, they went to the bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine, hoping to discover the mystery about them, for being a woman, she was curious. By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, \u2018I\u2019ll give you a box of pearls if you can take it up,\u2019 for she wanted to restore the poor things to life, and couldn\u2019t raise the heavy load herself. So the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found by a...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLittle goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\u201d said Amy, when Sallie\u2019s invention gave out. \u201cThe little girl was sorry for them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. \u2018Your geese will tell you, they know everything.\u2019 said the old woman. So she asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Cabbages!\u2019\u201d continued Laurie promptly. \u201c\u2018Just the thing,\u2019 said the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The knight in whom I\u2019m interested went back to find the pretty face, and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and married, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that, and mounting the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle to see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden. \u2018Will you give me a rose?\u2019 said he. \u2018You must come and get it. I can\u2019t come to you, it isn\u2019t proper,\u2019 said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher. Then he tried to push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped, saying imploringly, \u2018Let me in! Let me in!\u2019 But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in. Whether he did or not, Frank will tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m not playing, I never do,\u201d said Frank, dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple. Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?\u201d asked Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a while,\u201d said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his tutor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a piece of nonsense we have made! With practice we might do something quite clever. Do you know Truth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d said Meg soberly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe game, I mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said Fred.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn, and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question put by the rest. It\u2019s great fun.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s try it,\u201d said Jo, who liked new experiments.\r\n\r\nMiss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo, and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are your heroes?\u201d asked Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cGrandfather and Napoleon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich lady here do you think prettiest?\u201d said Sallie.\r\n\r\n\u201cMargaret.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich do you like best?\u201d from Fred.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat silly questions you ask!\u201d And Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at Laurie\u2019s matter-of-fact tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry again. Truth isn\u2019t a bad game,\u201d said Fred.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good one for you,\u201d retorted Jo in a low voice. Her turn came next.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your greatest fault?\u201d asked Fred, by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cA quick temper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you most wish for?\u201d said Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pair of boot lacings,\u201d returned Jo, guessing and defeating his purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a true answer. You must say what you really do want most.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGenius. Don\u2019t you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?\u201d And she slyly smiled in his disappointed face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat virtues do you most admire in a man?\u201d asked Sallie.\r\n\r\n\u201cCourage and honesty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow my turn,\u201d said Fred, as his hand came last.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s give it to him,\u201d whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded and asked at once...\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you cheat at croquet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes, a little bit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! Didn\u2019t you take your story out of The Sea Lion?\u201d said Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cRather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think the English nation perfect in every respect?\u201d asked Sallie.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be ashamed of myself if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a true John Bull. Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance without waiting to draw. I\u2019ll harrrow up your feelings first by asking if you don\u2019t think you are something of a flirt,\u201d said Laurie, as Jo nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou impertinent boy! Of course I\u2019m not,\u201d exclaimed Sallie, with an air that proved the contrary.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you hate most?\u201d asked Fred.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpiders and rice pudding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you like best?\u201d asked Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cDancing and French gloves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I think Truth is a very silly play. Let\u2019s have a sensible game of Authors to refresh our minds,\u201d proposed Jo.\r\n\r\nNed, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on, the three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out her sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with a book, which he did not read.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw,\u201d said Meg, with mingled admiration and regret in her voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you learn? I should think you had taste and talent for it,\u201d replied Miss Kate graciously.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy. So did mine, but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons privately, and then she was quite willing I should go on. Can\u2019t you do the same with your governess?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with us. Very fine schools they are, too, Papa says. You go to a private one, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t go at all. I am a governess myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said, \u201cDear me, how dreadful!\u201d for her tone implied it, and something in her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, \u201cYoung ladies in America love independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and respected for supporting themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, of course it\u2019s very nice and proper in them to do so. We have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,\u201d said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg\u2019s pride, and made her work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid the German song suit, Miss March?\u201d inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking an awkward pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! It was very sweet, and I\u2019m much obliged to whoever translated it for me.\u201d And Meg\u2019s downcast face brightened as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you read German?\u201d asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don\u2019t get on very fast alone, for I\u2019ve no one to correct my pronunciation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTry a little now. Here is Schiller\u2019s Mary Stuart and a tutor who loves to teach.\u201d And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard I\u2019m afraid to try,\u201d said Meg, grateful, but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll read a bit to encourage you.\u201d And Miss Kate read one of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless manner.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who said innocently, \u201cI thought it was poetry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of it is. Try this passage.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke\u2019s mouth as he opened at poor Mary\u2019s lament.\r\n\r\nMeg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice. Down the page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well indeed!\u201d said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.\r\n\r\nMiss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension, \u201cYou\u2019ve a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader. I advise you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers. I must look after Grace, she is romping.\u201d And Miss Kate strolled away, adding to herself with a shrug, \u201cI didn\u2019t come to chaperone a governess, though she is young and pretty. What odd people these Yankees are. I\u2019m afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses and don\u2019t treat them as we do,\u201d said Meg, looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cTutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my sorrow. There\u2019s no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.\u201d And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I live in it then. I don\u2019t like my work, but I get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won\u2019t complain. I only wished I liked teaching as you do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall be very sorry to lose him next year,\u201d said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in the turf.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing to college, I suppose?\u201d Meg\u2019s lips asked the question, but her eyes added, \u201cAnd what becomes of you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as he is off, I shall turn soldier. I am needed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad of that!\u201d exclaimed Meg. \u201cI should think every young man would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home,\u201d she added sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,\u201d said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.\r\n\r\n\u201cLaurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you,\u201d said Meg heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, that sounds pleasant,\u201d began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you love to ride?\u201d asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI dote upon it. My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was rich, but we don\u2019t keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,\u201d added Amy, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me about Ellen Tree. Is it a donkey?\u201d asked Grace curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we\u2019ve only got an old sidesaddle and no horse. Out in our garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow funny!\u201d laughed Grace. \u201cI have a pony at home, and ride nearly every day in the park with Fred and Kate. It\u2019s very nice, for my friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I\u2019d rather go to Rome than the Row,\u201d said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what the Row was and wouldn\u2019t have asked for the world.\r\n\r\nFrank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you are tired. Can I do anything for you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTalk to me, please. It\u2019s dull, sitting by myself,\u201d answered Frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.\r\n\r\nIf he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you like to talk about?\u201d she asked, fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,\u201d said Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.\r\n\r\nMy heart! What shall I do? I don\u2019t know anything about them, thought Beth, and forgetting the boy\u2019s misfortune in her flurry, she said, hoping to make him talk, \u201cI never saw any hunting, but I suppose you know all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for me,\u201d said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her innocent blunder.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,\u201d she said, turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys\u2019 books in which Jo delighted.\r\n\r\nBuffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her sisters\u2019 surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged protection.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him,\u201d said Jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cI always said she was a little saint,\u201d added Meg, as if there could be no further doubt of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,\u201d said Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,\u201d said Amy, well pleased at Beth\u2019s success. She meant \u2018facinating\u2019, but as Grace didn\u2019t know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded well and made a good impression.\r\n\r\nAn impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon. At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental, warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...\r\n\r\nAlone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,\r\n\r\nand at the lines...\r\n\r\nWe each are young, we each have a heart,\r\nOh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?\r\n\r\nhe looked at Meg with such a lackadaisical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can you be so cruel to me?\u201d he whispered, under cover of a lively chorus. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day, and now you snub me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and the talk after it.\r\n\r\nNed was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her rather pettishly, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a particle, but she\u2019s a dear,\u201d returned Sallie, defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a stricken deer anyway,\u201d said Ned, trying to be witty, and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.\r\n\r\nOn the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with cordial good nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada. As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, \u201cIn spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when one knows them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI quite agree with you,\u201d said Mr. Brooke.\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\nCASTLES IN THE AIR\r\n\r\nLaurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too lazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods, for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could live it over again. The hot weather made him indolent, and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke\u2019s patience to the utmost, displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat in the world are those girls about now?\u201d thought Laurie, opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio. All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s cool,\u201d said Laurie to himself, \u201cto have a picnic and never ask me! They can\u2019t be going in the boat, for they haven\u2019t got the key. Perhaps they forgot it. I\u2019ll take it to them, and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d\r\n\r\nThough possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went up the hill to take an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a landscape!\u201d thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and looking wide-awake and good-natured already.\r\n\r\nIt was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends. Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green. Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them. Amy was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud. A shadow passed over the boy\u2019s face as he watched them, feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit. He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I come in, please? Or shall I be a bother?\u201d he asked, advancing slowly.\r\n\r\nMeg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once, \u201cOf course you may. We should have asked you before, only we thought you wouldn\u2019t care for such a girl\u2019s game as this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI always like your games, but if Meg doesn\u2019t want me, I\u2019ll go away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no objection, if you do something. It\u2019s against the rules to be idle here,\u201d replied Meg gravely but graciously.\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch obliged. I\u2019ll do anything if you\u2019ll let me stop a bit, for it\u2019s as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I\u2019m ready.\u201d And Laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.\r\n\r\n\u201cFinish this story while I set my heel,\u201d said Jo, handing him the book.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the \u2018Busy Bee Society\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, ma\u2019am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you tell him?\u201d asked Meg of her sisters.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll laugh,\u201d said Amy warningly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d said Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess he\u2019ll like it,\u201d added Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I shall! I give you my word I won\u2019t laugh. Tell away, Jo, and don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to play Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all winter and summer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Laurie, nodding wisely.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho told you?\u201d demanded Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpirits.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I did. I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away, and he was rather dismal. He did like it, so don\u2019t scold, Jo,\u201d said Beth meekly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep a secret. Never mind, it saves trouble now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on, please,\u201d said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work, looking a trifle displeased.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we have tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn\u2019t dawdle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I should think so,\u201d and Laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring our work here and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill, and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow beautiful that is!\u201d said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but always splendid,\u201d replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime\u2014the real country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could ever go to it,\u201d said Beth musingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go, by-and-by, when we are good enough,\u201d answered Meg with her sweetest voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems so long to wait, so hard to do. I want to fly away at once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,\u201d said Jo. \u201cI\u2019m the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and maybe never get in after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have me for company, if that\u2019s any comfort. I shall have to do a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City. If I arrive late, you\u2019ll say a good word for me, won\u2019t you, Beth?\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething in the boy\u2019s face troubled his little friend, but she said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, \u201cIf people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will get in, for I don\u2019t believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true, and we could live in them?\u201d said Jo, after a little pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I\u2019d have,\u201d said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to take your favorite one. What is it?\u201d asked Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I tell mine, will you tell yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, if the girls will too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will. Now, Laurie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter I\u2019d seen as much of the world as I want to, I\u2019d like to settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose. I\u2019m to be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me. And I\u2019m never to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live for what I like. That\u2019s my favorite castle. What\u2019s yours, Meg?\u201d\r\n\r\nMargaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said slowly, \u201cI should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of luxurious things\u2014nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people, and heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit. How I should enjoy it! For I wouldn\u2019t be idle, but do good, and make everyone love me dearly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you have a master for your castle in the air?\u201d asked Laurie slyly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said \u2018pleasant people\u2019, you know,\u201d and Meg carefully tied up her shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say you\u2019d have a splendid, wise, good husband and some angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn\u2019t be perfect without,\u201d said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather scorned romance, except in books.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,\u201d answered Meg petulantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t I though? I\u2019d have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms piled high with books, and I\u2019d write out of a magic inkstand, so that my works should be as famous as Laurie\u2019s music. I want to do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that won\u2019t be forgotten after I\u2019m dead. I don\u2019t know what, but I\u2019m on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day. I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous, that would suit me, so that is my favorite dream.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take care of the family,\u201d said Beth contentedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you wish for anything else?\u201d asked Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cSince I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we may all keep well and be together, nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole world,\u201d was Amy\u2019s modest desire.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re an ambitious set, aren\u2019t we? Every one of us, but Beth, wants to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes,\u201d said Laurie, chewing grass like a meditative calf.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the door remains to be seen,\u201d observed Jo mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the key to mine, but I\u2019m not allowed to try it. Hang college!\u201d muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s mine!\u201d and Amy waved her pencil.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any,\u201d said Meg forlornly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you have,\u201d said Laurie at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn your face.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense, that\u2019s of no use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait and see if it doesn\u2019t bring you something worth having,\u201d replied the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew.\r\n\r\nMeg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we are all alive ten years hence, let\u2019s meet, and see how many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now,\u201d said Jo, always ready with a plan.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless me! How old I shall be, twenty-seven!\u201d exclaimed Meg, who felt grown up already, having just reached seventeen.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy twenty-two. What a venerable party!\u201d said Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but I\u2019m such a lazy dog, I\u2019m afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is sure you\u2019ll work splendidly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs she? By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!\u201d cried Laurie, sitting up with sudden energy. \u201cI ought to be satisfied to please Grandfather, and I do try, but it\u2019s working against the grain, you see, and comes hard. He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and I\u2019d rather be shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, and I don\u2019t care how soon they go to the bottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business. But he\u2019s set, and I\u2019ve got to do just as he did, unless I break away and please myself, as my father did. If there was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman, I\u2019d do it tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man\u2019s hatred of subjection, a young man\u2019s restless longing to try the world for himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cI advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home again till you have tried your own way,\u201d said Jo, whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was excited by what she called \u2018Teddy\u2019s Wrongs\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not right, Jo. You mustn\u2019t talk in that way, and Laurie mustn\u2019t take your bad advice. You should do just what your grandfather wishes, my dear boy,\u201d said Meg in her most maternal tone. \u201cDo your best at college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be hard on you or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with and love him, and you\u2019d never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission. Don\u2019t be dismal or fret, but do your duty and you\u2019ll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d asked Laurie, grateful for the good advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his own mother till she died, and wouldn\u2019t go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldn\u2019t leave her. And how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo he is, dear old fellow!\u201d said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story. \u201cIt\u2019s like Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn\u2019t understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you all in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I\u2019ll do for Brooke.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBegin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,\u201d said Meg sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know I do, Miss?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can always tell by his face when he goes away. If you have been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly. If you have plagued him, he\u2019s sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I like that? So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in Brooke\u2019s face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he passes your window, but I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d got up a telegraph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t. Don\u2019t be angry, and oh, don\u2019t tell him I said anything! It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here is said in confidence, you know,\u201d cried Meg, much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t tell tales,\u201d replied Laurie, with his \u2018high and mighty\u2019 air, as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. \u201cOnly if Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather for him to report.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be offended. I didn\u2019t mean to preach or tell tales or be silly. I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you\u2019d be sorry for by-and-by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.\u201d And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.\r\n\r\nAshamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand, and said frankly, \u201cI\u2019m the one to be forgiven. I\u2019m cross and have been out of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly, so don\u2019t mind if I am grumpy sometimes. I thank you all the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nBent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a fit person to belong to the \u2018Busy Bee Society\u2019. In the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea \u2018to draw\u2019, and they would just have time to get home to supper.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I come again?\u201d asked Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are told to do,\u201d said Meg, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may come, and I\u2019ll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do. There\u2019s a demand for socks just now,\u201d added Jo, waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie, standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David, whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019ll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\nSECRETS\r\n\r\nJo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow chilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa, writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her, while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen, exclaiming...\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, I\u2019ve done my best! If this won\u2019t suit I shall have to wait till I can do better.\u201d\r\n\r\nLying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through, making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points, which looked like little balloons. Then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo\u2019s desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall. In it she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves. From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.\r\n\r\nShe put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road. Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.\r\n\r\nIf anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street. Having found the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came. This maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake, pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out.\r\n\r\nThere was a dentist\u2019s sign, among others, which adorned the entrance, and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, \u201cIt\u2019s like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she\u2019ll need someone to help her home.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod. But he followed, asking with an air of sympathy, \u201cDid you have a bad time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot very.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou got through quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, thank goodness!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you go alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo,\u201d said Laurie, looking mystified.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBegging your pardon, ma\u2019am, it wasn\u2019t a billiard saloon, but a gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and we\u2019ll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie burst out with a hearty boy\u2019s laugh, which made several passers-by smile in spite of themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not. It\u2019s grand fun and will straighten you up capitally. But I don\u2019t believe that was your only reason for saying \u2018I\u2019m glad\u2019 in that decided way, was it now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you never go to such places. Do you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot often.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it\u2019s no fun unless you have good players, so, as I\u2019m fond of it, I come sometimes and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear, I\u2019m so sorry, for you\u2019ll get to liking it better and better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. I did hope you\u2019d stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends,\u201d said Jo, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability?\u201d asked Laurie, looking nettled.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends upon how and where he takes it. I don\u2019t like Ned and his set, and wish you\u2019d keep out of it. Mother won\u2019t let us have him at our house, though he wants to come. And if you grow like him she won\u2019t be willing to have us frolic together as we do now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t she?\u201d asked Laurie anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she can\u2019t bear fashionable young men, and she\u2019d shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she needn\u2019t get out her bandboxes yet. I\u2019m not a fashionable party and don\u2019t mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and then, don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don\u2019t get wild, will you? Or there will be an end of all our good times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be a double distilled saint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t bear saints. Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and we\u2019ll never desert you. I don\u2019t know what I should do if you acted like Mr. King\u2019s son. He had plenty of money, but didn\u2019t know how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his father\u2019s name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m likely to do the same? Much obliged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u2014oh, dear, no!\u2014but I hear people talking about money being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor. I shouldn\u2019t worry then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you worry about me, Jo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes do, for you\u2019ve got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I\u2019m afraid it would be hard to stop you.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips smiled as if at her warnings.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to deliver lectures all the way home?\u201d he asked presently.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not. Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause if you are, I\u2019ll take a bus. If you\u2019re not, I\u2019d like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t preach any more, and I\u2019d like to hear the news immensely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, then, come on. It\u2019s a secret, and if I tell you, you must tell me yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any,\u201d began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that she had.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know you have\u2014you can\u2019t hide anything, so up and \u2019fess, or I won\u2019t tell,\u201d cried Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs your secret a nice one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, isn\u2019t it! All about people you know, and such fun! You ought to hear it, and I\u2019ve been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you begin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll not say anything about it at home, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t tease me in private?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never tease.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you do. You get everything you want out of people. I don\u2019t know how you do it, but you are a born wheedler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. Fire away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve left two stories with a newspaperman, and he\u2019s to give his answer next week,\u201d whispered Jo, in her confidant\u2019s ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cHurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!\u201d cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children, for they were out of the city now.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! It won\u2019t come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn\u2019t rest till I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn\u2019t want anyone else to be disappointed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won\u2019t it be fun to see them in print, and shan\u2019t we feel proud of our authoress?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a friend\u2019s praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I\u2019ll never believe you again,\u201d she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn\u2019t promise not to, so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I\u2019ve told you any plummy bit of news I get. I know where Meg\u2019s glove is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite enough for the present, as you\u2019ll agree when I tell you where it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell, then.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo\u2019s ear, which produced a comical change. She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSaw it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPocket.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, isn\u2019t that romantic?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s horrid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. It\u2019s ridiculous, it won\u2019t be allowed. My patience! What would Meg say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not to tell anyone. Mind that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t promise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was understood, and I trusted you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I won\u2019t for the present, anyway, but I\u2019m disgusted, and wish you hadn\u2019t told me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see anyone try it,\u201d cried Jo fiercely.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo should I!\u201d and Laurie chuckled at the idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that,\u201d said Jo rather ungratefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cRace down this hill with me, and you\u2019ll be all right,\u201d suggested Laurie.\r\n\r\nNo one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air, and not lose my breath. It was capital, but see what a guy it\u2019s made me. Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are,\u201d said Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.\r\n\r\nLaurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again. But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat in the world are you doing here?\u201d she asked, regarding her disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cGetting leaves,\u201d meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd hairpins,\u201d added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo\u2019s lap. \u201cThey grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been running, Jo. How could you? When will you stop such romping ways?\u201d said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever till I\u2019m stiff and old and have to use a crutch. Don\u2019t try to make me grow up before my time, Meg. It\u2019s hard enough to have you change all of a sudden. Let me be a little girl as long as I can.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman, and Laurie\u2019s secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near. He saw the trouble in her face and drew Meg\u2019s attention from it by asking quickly, \u201cWhere have you been calling, all so fine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the Gardiners\u2019, and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle Moffat\u2019s wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend the winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you envy her, Meg?\u201d said Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of it!\u201d muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Meg, looking surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a poor man,\u201d said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to mind what she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never \u2018go and marry\u2019 anyone,\u201d observed Meg, walking on with great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping stones, and \u2018behaving like children\u2019, as Meg said to herself, though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on.\r\n\r\nFor a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered. She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner. Laurie and she were always making signs to one another, and talking about \u2018Spread Eagles\u2019 till the girls declared they had both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in Amy\u2019s bower. What went on there, Meg could not see, but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do with that girl? She never will behave like a young lady,\u201d sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope she won\u2019t. She is so funny and dear as she is,\u201d said Beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo\u2019s having secrets with anyone but her.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very trying, but we never can make her commy la fo,\u201d added Amy, who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a very becoming way, two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected to read.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you anything interesting there?\u201d asked Meg, with condescension.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing but a story, won\u2019t amount to much, I guess,\u201d returned Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better read it aloud. That will amuse us and keep you out of mischief,\u201d said Amy in her most grown-up tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the name?\u201d asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind the sheet.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Rival Painters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat sounds well. Read it,\u201d said Meg.\r\n\r\nWith a loud \u201cHem!\u201d and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast. The girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. \u201cI like that about the splendid picture,\u201d was Amy\u2019s approving remark, as Jo paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cI prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite names, isn\u2019t that queer?\u201d said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the lovering part was tragical.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho wrote it?\u201d asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo\u2019s face.\r\n\r\nThe reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice, \u201cYour sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou?\u201d cried Meg, dropping her work.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d said Amy critically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew it! I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!\u201d and Beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success.\r\n\r\nDear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! How Meg wouldn\u2019t believe it till she saw the words. \u201cMiss Josephine March,\u201d actually printed in the paper. How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately couldn\u2019t be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead. How Beth got excited, and skipped and sang with joy. How Hannah came in to exclaim, \u201cSakes alive, well I never!\u201d in great astonishment at \u2018that Jo\u2019s doin\u2019s\u2019. How proud Mrs. March was when she knew it. How Jo laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it, and how the \u2018Spread Eagle\u2019 might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell us about it.\u201d \u201cWhen did it come?\u201d \u201cHow much did you get for it?\u201d \u201cWhat will Father say?\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t Laurie laugh?\u201d cried the family, all in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop jabbering, girls, and I\u2019ll tell you everything,\u201d said Jo, wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did over her \u2018Rival Painters\u2019. Having told how she disposed of her tales, Jo added, \u201cAnd when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them both, but didn\u2019t pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and noticed the stories. It was good practice, he said, and when the beginners improved, anyone would pay. So I let him have the two stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him. And he said it was good, and I shall write more, and he\u2019s going to get the next paid for, and I am so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end.\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\nA TELEGRAM\r\n\r\n\u201cNovember is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,\u201d said Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking out at the frostbitten garden.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I was born in it,\u201d observed Jo pensively, quite unconscious of the blot on her nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a delightful month,\u201d said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything, even November.\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family,\u201d said Meg, who was out of sorts. \u201cWe go grubbing along day after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun. We might as well be in a treadmill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy patience, how blue we are!\u201d cried Jo. \u201cI don\u2019t much wonder, poor dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you grind, grind, year in and year out. Oh, don\u2019t I wish I could manage things for you as I do for my heroines! You\u2019re pretty enough and good enough already, so I\u2019d have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly. Then you\u2019d dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have to work and women marry for money. It\u2019s a dreadfully unjust world,\u201d said Meg bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo and I are going to make fortunes for you all. Just wait ten years, and see if we don\u2019t,\u201d said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t wait, and I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t much faith in ink and dirt, though I\u2019m grateful for your good intentions.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again. Jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window, said, smiling, \u201cTwo pleasant things are going to happen right away. Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, \u201cAny letter from Father, girls?\u201d and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, \u201cWon\u2019t some of you come for a drive? I\u2019ve been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle, and I\u2019m going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn. It\u2019s a dull day, but the air isn\u2019t bad, and I\u2019m going to take Brooke home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn\u2019t out. Come, Jo, you and Beth will go, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course we will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch obliged, but I\u2019m busy.\u201d And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not to drive too often with the young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe three will be ready in a minute,\u201d cried Amy, running away to wash her hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I do anything for you, Madam Mother?\u201d asked Laurie, leaning over Mrs. March\u2019s chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank you, except call at the office, if you\u2019ll be so kind, dear. It\u2019s our day for a letter, and the postman hasn\u2019t been. Father is as regular as the sun, but there\u2019s some delay on the way, perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\nA sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a letter.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,\u201d she said, handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.\r\n\r\nAt the word \u2018telegraph\u2019, Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed downstairs for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a frightened voice...\r\n\r\nMrs. March:\r\nYour husband is very ill. Come at once.\r\nS. HALE\r\nBlank Hospital, Washington.\r\n\r\nHow still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.\r\n\r\nMrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never forgot, \u201cI shall go at once, but it may be too late. Oh, children, children, help me to bear it!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears. Poor Hannah was the first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example, for with her, work was panacea for most afflictions.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Lord keep the dear man! I won\u2019t waste no time a-cryin\u2019, but git your things ready right away, mum,\u201d she said heartily, as she wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, there\u2019s no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and let me think.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Laurie?\u201d she asked presently, when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, ma\u2019am. Oh, let me do something!\u201d cried the boy, hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.\r\n\r\n\u201cSend a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train goes early in the morning. I\u2019ll take that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else? The horses are ready. I can go anywhere, do anything,\u201d he said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave a note at Aunt March\u2019s. Jo, give me that pen and paper.\u201d\r\n\r\nTearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to add a little to the sum for her father.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow go, dear, but don\u2019t kill yourself driving at a desperate pace. There is no need of that.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. March\u2019s warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his life.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can\u2019t come. On the way get these things. I\u2019ll put them down, they\u2019ll be needed and I must go prepared for nursing. Hospital stores are not always good. Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine. I\u2019m not too proud to beg for Father. He shall have the best of everything. Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and Meg, come and help me find my things, for I\u2019m half bewildered.\u201d\r\n\r\nWriting, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while, and let them work. Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell.\r\n\r\nMr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mother\u2019s absence, which comforted her very much. There was nothing he didn\u2019t offer, from his own dressing gown to himself as escort. But the last was impossible. Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman\u2019s undertaking the long journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it, for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he\u2019d be back directly. No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,\u201d he said, in the kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit. \u201cI came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there.\u201d\r\n\r\nDown dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow kind you all are! Mother will accept, I\u2019m sure, and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her. Thank you very, very much!\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.\r\n\r\nEverything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time. Mrs. March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she had been there.\r\n\r\nThe short afternoon wore away. All other errands were done, and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a \u2018slap and a bang\u2019, but still Jo did not come. They began to get anxious, and Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take into her head. He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a little choke in her voice, \u201cThat\u2019s my contribution toward making Father comfortable and bringing him home!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope you haven\u2019t done anything rash?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s mine honestly. I didn\u2019t beg, borrow, or steal it. I earned it, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour hair! Your beautiful hair!\u201d \u201cOh, Jo, how could you? Your one beauty.\u201d \u201cMy dear girl, there was no need of this.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle, and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect the fate of the nation, so don\u2019t wail, Beth. It will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig. It will do my brains good to have that mop taken off. My head feels deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order. I\u2019m satisfied, so please take the money and let\u2019s have supper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me all about it, Jo. I am not quite satisfied, but I can\u2019t blame you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call it, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I\u2019m afraid you will regret it one of these days,\u201d said Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t!\u201d returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat made you do it?\u201d asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was wild to do something for Father,\u201d replied Jo, as they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble. \u201cI hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence. Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money, if I sold the nose off my face to get it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings,\u201d said Mrs. March with a look that warmed Jo\u2019s heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I\u2019d like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a barber\u2019s window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars. It came to me all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you dared to do it,\u201d said Beth in a tone of awe.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair. He rather stared at first, as if he wasn\u2019t used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. He said he didn\u2019t care about mine, it wasn\u2019t the fashionable color, and he never paid much for it in the first place. The work put into it made it dear, and so on. It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn\u2019t done right away that I shouldn\u2019t have it done at all, and you know when I start to do a thing, I hate to give it up. So I begged him to take it, and told him why I was in such a hurry. It was silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, \u2018Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady. I\u2019d do as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was Jimmy?\u201d asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they went along.\r\n\r\n\u201cHer son, she said, who was in the army. How friendly such things make strangers feel, don\u2019t they? She talked away all the time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?\u201d asked Meg, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that was the end of it. I never snivel over trifles like that. I will confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost seemed as if I\u2019d an arm or leg off. The woman saw me look at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep. I\u2019ll give it to you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don\u2019t think I shall ever have a mane again.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk. She only said, \u201cThank you, deary,\u201d but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke\u2019s kindness, the prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to be nursed.\r\n\r\nNo one wanted to go to bed when at ten o\u2019clock Mrs. March put by the last finished job, and said, \u201cCome girls.\u201d Beth went to the piano and played the father\u2019s favorite hymn. All began bravely, but broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to bed and don\u2019t talk, for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get. Good night, my darlings,\u201d said Mrs. March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.\r\n\r\nThey kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room. Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life. Jo lay motionless, and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...\r\n\r\n\u201cJo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy... My hair!\u201d burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d protested Jo, with a choke. \u201cI\u2019d do it again tomorrow, if I could. It\u2019s only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way. Don\u2019t tell anyone, it\u2019s all over now. I thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my one beauty. How came you to be awake?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m so anxious,\u201d said Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cThink about something pleasant, and you\u2019ll soon drop off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you think of?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHandsome faces\u2014eyes particularly,\u201d answered Meg, smiling to herself in the dark.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat color do you like best?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBrown, that is, sometimes. Blue are lovely.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air.\r\n\r\nThe clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here, settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter. As she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face, which seemed to whisper in the silence, \u201cBe comforted, dear soul! There is always light behind the clouds.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\nLETTERS\r\n\r\nIn the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before. For now the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within. Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah\u2019s familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother\u2019s cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution. Meg\u2019s eyes kept filling in spite of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.\r\n\r\nNobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag...\r\n\r\n\u201cChildren, I leave you to Hannah\u2019s care and Mr. Laurence\u2019s protection. Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don\u2019t grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMeg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don\u2019t get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to help and cheer all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and you, Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will, Mother! We will!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well. No one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.\r\n\r\nLaurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him \u2018Mr. Greatheart\u2019 on the spot.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!\u201d whispered Mrs. March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried into the carriage.\r\n\r\nAs she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it also, and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow kind everyone is to us!\u201d she said, turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how they can help it,\u201d returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel as if there had been an earthquake,\u201d said Jo, as their neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems as if half the house was gone,\u201d added Meg forlornly.\r\n\r\nBeth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother\u2019s table, showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It was a little thing, but it went straight to their hearts, and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.\r\n\r\nHannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with a coffeepot.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don\u2019t fret. Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let\u2019s fall to work and be a credit to the family.\u201d\r\n\r\nCoffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. They drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes were all right again.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Hope and keep busy\u2019, that\u2019s the motto for us, so let\u2019s see who will remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won\u2019t she lecture though!\u201d said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall go to my Kings, though I\u2019d much rather stay at home and attend to things here,\u201d said Meg, wishing she hadn\u2019t made her eyes so red.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo need of that. Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,\u201d put in Amy, with an important air.\r\n\r\n\u201cHannah will tell us what to do, and we\u2019ll have everything nice when you come home,\u201d added Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub without delay.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think anxiety is very interesting,\u201d observed Amy, eating sugar pensively.\r\n\r\nThe girls couldn\u2019t help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother\u2019s face. It was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so like my Beth!\u201d said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face. \u201cGoodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won\u2019t strain today. Don\u2019t fret about Father, dear,\u201d she added, as they parted.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I hope Aunt March won\u2019t croak. Your hair is becoming, and it looks very boyish and nice,\u201d returned Meg, trying not to smile at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister\u2019s shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my only comfort.\u201d And, touching her hat a la Laurie, away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.\r\n\r\nNews from their father comforted the girls very much, for though dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which grew more cheerful as the week passed. At first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and read them.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Mother:\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for the news was so good we couldn\u2019t help laughing and crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence\u2019s business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father. The girls are all as good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if I didn\u2019t know her \u2018moral fit\u2019 wouldn\u2019t last long. Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told her. She grieves about Father, and looks sober except when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint. She does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We are all well and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...\r\n\r\nMEG\r\n\r\nThis note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed letters.\r\n\r\nMy precious Marmee:\r\n\r\nThree cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank God for being so good to us, but I could only cry, and say, \u201cI\u2019m glad! I\u2019m glad!\u201d Didn\u2019t that do as well as a regular prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so desperately good, it\u2019s like living in a nest of turtledoves. You\u2019d laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I\u2019m in love with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I\u2014well, I\u2019m Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn\u2019t speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn\u2019t come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn\u2019t and got mad. It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it\u2019s hard to beg pardon. But I thought he\u2019d come to it, for I was in the right. He didn\u2019t come, and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each other\u2019s pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.\r\n\r\nI made a \u2018pome\u2019 yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash, and as Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him. Give him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times for your...\r\n\r\nTOPSY-TURVY JO\r\n\r\nA SONG FROM THE SUDS\r\n\r\nQueen of my tub, I merrily sing,\r\nWhile the white foam rises high,\r\nAnd sturdily wash and rinse and wring,\r\nAnd fasten the clothes to dry.\r\nThen out in the free fresh air they swing,\r\nUnder the sunny sky.\r\n\r\nI wish we could wash from our hearts and souls\r\nThe stains of the week away,\r\nAnd let water and air by their magic make\r\nOurselves as pure as they.\r\nThen on the earth there would be indeed,\r\nA glorious washing day!\r\n\r\nAlong the path of a useful life,\r\nWill heart\u2019s-ease ever bloom.\r\nThe busy mind has no time to think\r\nOf sorrow or care or gloom.\r\nAnd anxious thoughts may be swept away,\r\nAs we bravely wield a broom.\r\n\r\nI am glad a task to me is given,\r\nTo labor at day by day,\r\nFor it brings me health and strength and hope,\r\nAnd I cheerfully learn to say,\r\n\u201cHead, you may think, Heart, you may feel,\r\nBut, Hand, you shall work alway!\u201d\r\n\r\nDear Mother,\r\n\r\nThere is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to see. I read every morning, try to be good all day, and sing myself to sleep with Father\u2019s tune. I can\u2019t sing \u2018LAND OF THE LEAL\u2019 now, it makes me cry. Everyone is very kind, and we are as happy as we can be without you. Amy wants the rest of the page, so I must stop. I didn\u2019t forget to cover the holders, and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day.\r\n\r\nKiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine. Oh, do come soon to your loving...\r\n\r\nLITTLE BETH\r\n\r\nMa Chere Mamma,\r\n\r\nWe are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate the girls\u2014Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words and you can take the properest. Meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because it keeps me sweet tempered. Laurie is not as respeckful as he ought to be now I am almost in my teens, he calls me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King does. The sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out, and Meg put in new ones, but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress. I felt bad but did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more starch in my aprons and have buckwheats every day. Can\u2019t she? Didn\u2019t I make that interrigation point nice? Meg says my punchtuation and spelling are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but dear me I have so many things to do, I can\u2019t stop. Adieu, I send heaps of love to Papa. Your affectionate daughter...\r\n\r\nAMY CURTIS MARCH\r\n\r\nDear Mis March,\r\n\r\nI jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The girls is clever and fly round right smart. Miss Meg is going to make a proper good housekeeper. She hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin ahead, but she don\u2019t stop to cal\u2019k\u2019late fust, and you never know where she\u2019s like to bring up. She done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she starched \u2019em afore they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should a died a laughin. Beth is the best of little creeters, and a sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She tries to learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her years, likewise keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful. We have got on very economical so fur. I don\u2019t let the girls hev coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well without frettin, wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes as usual, and turns the house upside down frequent, but he heartens the girls, so I let em hev full swing. The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin, but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread is riz, so no more at this time. I send my duty to Mr. March, and hope he\u2019s seen the last of his Pewmonia.\r\n\r\nYours respectful,\r\nHannah Mullet\r\n\r\nHead Nurse of Ward No. 2,\r\n\r\nAll serene on the Rappahannock, troops in fine condition, commisary department well conducted, the Home Guard under Colonel Teddy always on duty, Commander in Chief General Laurence reviews the army daily, Quartermaster Mullet keeps order in camp, and Major Lion does picket duty at night. A salute of twenty-four guns was fired on receipt of good news from Washington, and a dress parade took place at headquarters. Commander in chief sends best wishes, in which he is heartily joined by...\r\n\r\nCOLONEL TEDDY\r\n\r\nDear Madam:\r\n\r\nThe little girls are all well. Beth and my boy report daily. Hannah is a model servant, and guards pretty Meg like a dragon. Glad the fine weather holds. Pray make Brooke useful, and draw on me for funds if expenses exceed your estimate. Don\u2019t let your husband want anything. Thank God he is mending.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend and servant, JAMES LAURENCE\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\nLITTLE FAITHFUL\r\n\r\nFor a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood. It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old ways. They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.\r\n\r\nJo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March didn\u2019t like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the Washington dispatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.\r\n\r\nAll the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters\u2019 also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs.\r\n\r\nAll were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and deserved praise. So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.\r\n\r\n\u201cMeg, I wish you\u2019d go and see the Hummels. You know Mother told us not to forget them.\u201d said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March\u2019s departure.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m too tired to go this afternoon,\u201d replied Meg, rocking comfortably as she sewed.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you, Jo?\u201d asked Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cToo stormy for me with my cold.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought it was almost well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to go to the Hummels\u2019,\u201d said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go yourself?\u201d asked Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don\u2019t know what to do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of it. But it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to go.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAsk Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air will do you good,\u201d said Jo, adding apologetically, \u201cI\u2019d go but I want to finish my writing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy head aches and I\u2019m tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go,\u201d said Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,\u201d suggested Meg.\r\n\r\nSo Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and the Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed. Amy did not come, Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story, and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes. It was late when she came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother\u2019s room. Half an hour after, Jo went to \u2018Mother\u2019s closet\u2019 for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cChristopher Columbus! What\u2019s the matter?\u201d cried Jo, as Beth put out her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly. . .\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had the scarlet fever, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYears ago, when Meg did. Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby\u2019s dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat baby?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Hummel\u2019s. It died in my lap before she got home,\u201d cried Beth with a sob.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone,\u201d said Jo, taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother\u2019s big chair, with a remorseful face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute it was sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn\u2019t stir, and I knew it was dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, dear! What did you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor. He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore throats. \u2018Scarlet fever, ma\u2019am. Ought to have called me before,\u2019 he said crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay. He smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right away, or I\u2019d have the fever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you won\u2019t!\u201d cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look. \u201cOh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What shall we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, I guess I shan\u2019t have it badly. I looked in Mother\u2019s book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel better,\u201d said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Mother was only at home!\u201d exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She read a page, looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said gravely, \u201cYou\u2019ve been over the baby every day for more than a week, and among the others who are going to have it, so I\u2019m afraid you are going to have it, Beth. I\u2019ll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let Amy come. She never had it, and I should hate to give it to her. Can\u2019t you and Meg have it over again?\u201d asked Beth, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess not. Don\u2019t care if I do. Serve me right, selfish pig, to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!\u201d muttered Jo, as she went to consult Hannah.\r\n\r\nThe good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll do,\u201d said Hannah, when she had examined and questioned Beth, \u201cwe will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at you, dear, and see that we start right. Then we\u2019ll send Amy off to Aunt March\u2019s for a spell, to keep her out of harm\u2019s way, and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall stay, of course, I\u2019m oldest,\u201d began Meg, looking anxious and self-reproachful.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall, because it\u2019s my fault she is sick. I told Mother I\u2019d do the errands, and I haven\u2019t,\u201d said Jo decidedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich will you have, Beth? There ain\u2019t no need of but one,\u201d aid Hannah.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo, please.\u201d And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look, which effectually settled that point.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and tell Amy,\u201d said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.\r\n\r\nAmy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, and commanded, all in vain. Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head in the sofa cushions. She told her story, expecting to be consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, \u201cNow be a sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don\u2019t cry, but hear what a jolly plan I\u2019ve got. You go to Aunt March\u2019s, and I\u2019ll come and take you out every day, driving or walking, and we\u2019ll have capital times. Won\u2019t that be better than moping here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,\u201d began Amy, in an injured voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless your heart, child, it\u2019s to keep you well. You don\u2019t want to be sick, do you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t, but I dare say I shall be, for I\u2019ve been with Beth all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s dull at Aunt March\u2019s, and she is so cross,\u201d said Amy, looking rather frightened.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is, and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I\u2019ll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won\u2019t peck at us, whatever we do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn my honor as a gentleman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd come every single day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSee if I don\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd bring me back the minute Beth is well?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe identical minute.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd go to the theater, truly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA dozen theaters, if we may.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014I guess I will,\u201d said Amy slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood girl! Call Meg, and tell her you\u2019ll give in,\u201d said Laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the \u2018giving in\u2019.\r\n\r\nMeg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is the little dear?\u201d asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is lying down on Mother\u2019s bed, and feels better. The baby\u2019s death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,\u201d answered Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a trying world it is!\u201d said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful way. \u201cNo sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother\u2019s gone, so I\u2019m all at sea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t make a porcupine of yourself, it isn\u2019t becoming. Settle your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do anything?\u201d asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friend\u2019s one beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is what troubles me,\u201d said Meg. \u201cI think we ought to tell her if Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn\u2019t, for Mother can\u2019t leave Father, and it will only make them anxious. Beth won\u2019t be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn\u2019t seem quite right to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum, well, I can\u2019t say. Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor has been.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,\u201d commanded Meg. \u201cWe can\u2019t decide anything till he has been.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStay where you are, Jo. I\u2019m errand boy to this establishment,\u201d said Laurie, taking up his cap.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you are busy,\u201d began Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve done my lessons for the day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you study in vacation time?\u201d asked Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI follow the good example my neighbors set me,\u201d was Laurie\u2019s answer, as he swung himself out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have great hopes for my boy,\u201d observed Jo, watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe does very well, for a boy,\u201d was Meg\u2019s somewhat ungracious answer, for the subject did not interest her.\r\n\r\nDr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story. Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.\r\n\r\nAunt March received them with her usual hospitality.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles, while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out...\r\n\r\n\u201cGo away. No boys allowed here.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn\u2019t sick, which I\u2019ve no doubt she will be, looks like it now. Don\u2019t cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot\u2019s tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out, \u201cBless my boots!\u201d in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you hear from your mother?\u201d asked the old lady gruffly.\r\n\r\n\u201cFather is much better,\u201d replied Jo, trying to keep sober.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, is he? Well, that won\u2019t last long, I fancy. March never had any stamina,\u201d was the cheerful reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa, ha! Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!\u201d squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady\u2019s cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! And, Jo, you\u2019d better go at once. It isn\u2019t proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!\u201d cried Polly, tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the \u2018rattlepated\u2019 boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can bear it, but I\u2019ll try,\u201d thought Amy, as she was left alone with Aunt March.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet along, you fright!\u201d screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy could not restrain a sniff.\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\nDARK DAYS\r\n\r\nBeth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of Beth\u2019s illness. She could not think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn\u2019t hear of \u2018Mrs. March bein\u2019 told, and worried just for sech a trifle.\u2019\r\n\r\nJo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself. But there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she \u2018would think of it, though there was no danger yet\u2019. A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a long while.\r\n\r\nHow dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buy\u2014in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of Beth\u2019s nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth\u2019s unselfish ambition to live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. Everyone missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little Beth had made.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege. She longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth\u2019s side.\r\n\r\nThe first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low voice to Hannah, \u201cIf Mrs. March can leave her husband she\u2019d better be sent for.\u201d\r\n\r\nHannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly, \u201cWhat is it? Is Beth worse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve sent for Mother,\u201d said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?\u201d asked Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. The doctor told us to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jo, it\u2019s not so bad as that?\u201d cried Laurie, with a startled face.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is. She doesn\u2019t know us, she doesn\u2019t even talk about the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. She doesn\u2019t look like my Beth, and there\u2019s nobody to help us bear it. Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can\u2019t find Him.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the tears streamed fast down poor Jo\u2019s cheeks, she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat, \u201cI\u2019m here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe could not speak, but she did \u2018hold on\u2019, and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.\r\n\r\nLaurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful face.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Teddy, I\u2019m better now. I don\u2019t feel so forlorn, and will try to bear it if it comes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo. Soon your mother will be here, and then everything will be all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad Father is better. Now she won\u2019t feel so bad about leaving him. Oh, me! It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,\u201d sighed Jo, spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t Meg pull fair?\u201d asked Laurie, looking indignant.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, she tries to, but she can\u2019t love Bethy as I do, and she won\u2019t miss her as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I can\u2019t give her up. I can\u2019t! I can\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\nDown went Jo\u2019s face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It might be unmanly, but he couldn\u2019t help it, and I am glad of it. Presently, as Jo\u2019s sobs quieted, he said hopefully, \u201cI don\u2019t think she will die. She\u2019s so good, and we all love her so much, I don\u2019t believe God will take her away yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe good and dear people always do die,\u201d groaned Jo, but she stopped crying, for her friend\u2019s words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor girl, you\u2019re worn out. It isn\u2019t like you to be forlorn. Stop a bit. I\u2019ll hearten you up in a jiffy.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down on Beth\u2019s little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, \u201cI drink\u2014 Health to my Beth! You are a good doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend. How can I ever pay you?\u201d she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I\u2019ll give you something that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,\u201d said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she\u2019d come at once, and she\u2019ll be here tonight, and everything will be all right. Aren\u2019t you glad I did it?\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, \u201cOh, Laurie! Oh, Mother! I am so glad!\u201d She did not weep again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news.\r\n\r\nLaurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind. He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying breathlessly, \u201cOh, don\u2019t! I didn\u2019t mean to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn\u2019t help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don\u2019t give me wine again, it makes me act so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. \u201cWhy, you see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought to know. She\u2019d never forgive us if Beth... Well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram. I never can bear to be \u2018lorded over\u2019, so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in at two A.M. I shall go for her, and you\u2019ve only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLaurie, you\u2019re an angel! How shall I ever thank you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFly at me again. I rather liked it,\u201d said Laurie, looking mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don\u2019t tease, but go home and rest, for you\u2019ll be up half the night. Bless you, Teddy, bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\nJo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was \u201chappy, oh, so happy!\u201d while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away,\u201d said Hannah, with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news.\r\n\r\nMeg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah \u201cknocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected\u201d. A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change. Beth\u2019s bird began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy\u2019s bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness, and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, \u201cMother\u2019s coming, dear! Mother\u2019s coming!\u201d Every one rejoiced but Beth. She lay in that heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter, \u201cWater!\u201d with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word. All day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged slowly by. But night came at last, and every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that some change, for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which time he would return.\r\n\r\nHannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed\u2019s foot and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March\u2019s countenance as she entered. Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.\r\n\r\nThe girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf God spares Beth, I never will complain again,\u201d whispered Meg earnestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf God spares Beth, I\u2019ll try to love and serve Him all my life,\u201d answered Jo, with equal fervor.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I had no heart, it aches so,\u201d sighed Meg, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf life is often as hard as this, I don\u2019t see how we ever shall get through it,\u201d added her sister despondently.\r\n\r\nHere the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie\u2019s quiet departure for the station. Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls.\r\n\r\nIt was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother\u2019s easy chair with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as she thought, \u201cBeth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, \u201cGood-by, my Beth. Good-by!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, \u201cThe fever\u2019s turned, she\u2019s sleepin\u2019 nat\u2019ral, her skin\u2019s damp, and she breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh, my goodness me!\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to confirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, \u201cYes, my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her...\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Mother would only come now!\u201d said Jo, as the winter night began to wane.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee,\u201d said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, \u201cI thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth\u2019s hand tomorrow if she\u2014went away from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little rose, and Mother\u2019s face.\u201d\r\n\r\nNever had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks like a fairy world,\u201d said Meg, smiling to herself, as she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.\r\n\r\n\u201cHark!\u201d cried Jo, starting to her feet.\r\n\r\nYes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah, and then Laurie\u2019s voice saying in a joyful whisper, \u201cGirls, she\u2019s come! She\u2019s come!\u201d\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\r\nAMY\u2019S WILL\r\n\r\nWhile these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at Aunt March\u2019s. She felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew\u2019s children, though she didn\u2019t think it proper to confess it. She really did her best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize with children\u2019s little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy\u2019s soul, and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.\r\n\r\nShe had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone. Then she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was. Not a speck escaped Aunt March\u2019s eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly had to be fed, the lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair. After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play, and didn\u2019t she enjoy it?\r\n\r\nLaurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times. After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime. The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time. The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird. Then she could not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady.\r\n\r\nEsther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with \u2018Madame\u2019, as she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change her religion. She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame\u2019s laces. She also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy\u2019s chief delight was an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover\u2019s diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March\u2019s big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March\u2019s wedding ring, too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?\u201d asked Esther, who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I\u2019m fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose this if I might,\u201d replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.\r\n\r\n\u201cI, too, covet that, but not as a necklace. Ah, no! To me it is a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,\u201d said Esther, eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads hanging over your glass?\u201d asked Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cTruly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort, but as that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame. She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould it be right for me to do so too?\u201d asked Amy, who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind her of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.\u201d\r\n\r\nEsther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March dies,\u201d she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo you and your sisters. I know it, Madame confides in me. I witnessed her will, and it is to be so,\u201d whispered Esther smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow nice! But I wish she\u2019d let us have them now. Procrastination is not agreeable,\u201d observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it, and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think so? Oh, I\u2019ll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely ring! It\u2019s ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant\u2019s. I do like Aunt March after all.\u201d And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it.\r\n\r\nFrom that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor care if she did. It was, however, a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy\u2019s beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart. On the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every day to \u2018sit alone\u2019 thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to preserve her sister. Esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children. She missed her mother\u2019s help to understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly. But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old lady\u2019s jewels.\r\n\r\nDuring one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she did not hear Laurie\u2019s ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, \u201cAin\u2019t we fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha! Ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to consult you about a very serious matter,\u201d said Amy, when she had shown her splendor and driven Polly into a corner. \u201cThat bird is the trial of my life,\u201d she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went to let him out, and found a big spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase. Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, \u2018Come out and take a walk, my dear.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t help laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid the spider accept the old fellow\u2019s invitation?\u201d asked Laurie, yawning.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and scrambled up on Aunt\u2019s chair, calling out, \u2018Catch her! Catch her! Catch her!\u2019 as I chased the spider.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie! Oh, lor!\u201d cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie\u2019s toes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\u201d cried Laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely croaked, \u201cAllyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019m ready,\u201d said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket. \u201cI want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is legal and right. I felt I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and I don\u2019t want any ill feeling over my tomb.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the spelling:\r\n\r\nMY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT\r\n\r\nI, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all my earthly property\u2014viz. to wit:\u2014namely\r\n\r\nTo my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he likes with.\r\n\r\nTo my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets\u2014also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.\r\n\r\nTo my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her \u2018little girl\u2019.\r\n\r\nTo Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my bronze inkstand\u2014she lost the cover\u2014and my most precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.\r\n\r\nTo Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being thin when she gets well. And I herewith also leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.\r\n\r\nTo my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn\u2019t any neck. Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.\r\n\r\nTo our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family, especially Beth.\r\n\r\nI wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.\r\n\r\nTo Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave hoping she \u2018will remember me, when it you see\u2019.\r\n\r\nAnd now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead. I forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. Amen.\r\n\r\nTo this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.\r\n\r\nAmy Curtis March\r\n\r\nWitnesses:\r\n\r\nEstelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.\r\n\r\nThe last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat put it into your head? Did anyone tell you about Beth\u2019s giving away her things?\u201d asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.\r\n\r\nShe explained and then asked anxiously, \u201cWhat about Beth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I spoke, but as I did, I\u2019ll tell you. She felt so ill one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake. She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of us, and her best love to Grandpa. She never thought of a will.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper. Amy\u2019s face was full of trouble, but she only said, \u201cDon\u2019t people put sort of postscripts to their wills, sometimes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, \u2018codicils\u2019, they call them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPut one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and given round to my friends. I forgot it, but I want it done though it will spoil my looks.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie added it, smiling at Amy\u2019s last and greatest sacrifice. Then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips, \u201cIs there really any danger about Beth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don\u2019t cry, dear.\u201d And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart, feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister.\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY\r\nCONFIDENTIAL\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters. Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg\u2019s tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and Mother\u2019s face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep.\r\n\r\nHannah had \u2018dished up\u2019 an astonishing breakfast for the traveler, finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened to her whispered account of Father\u2019s state, Mr. Brooke\u2019s promise to stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie\u2019s hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange yet pleasant day that was. So brilliant and gay without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow. So quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching, and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave Beth\u2019s side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered treasure.\r\n\r\nLaurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well that Aunt March actually \u2018sniffed\u2019 herself, and never once said \u201cI told you so\u201d. Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie\u2019s opinion, that she behaved \u2018like a capital little woman\u2019. Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl, blessed her buttons, and begged her to \u201ccome and take a walk, dear\u201d, in his most affable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till night, and I\u2019m not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by Amy\u2019s cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her mother\u2019s lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, I like it very much, dear,\u201d looking from the dusty rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen. \u201cIt is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I\u2019ve tried to make. The woman\u2019s face is not good, it\u2019s too beautiful for me to draw, but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to think He was a little child once, for then I don\u2019t seem so far away, and that helps me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother\u2019s knee, Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. She said nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute\u2019s pause, she added gravely, \u201cI wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the ring today. She called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she\u2019d like to keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it\u2019s too big. I\u2019d like to wear them Mother, can I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are very pretty, but I think you\u2019re rather too young for such ornaments, Amy,\u201d said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to be vain,\u201d said Amy. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like it only because it\u2019s so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet, to remind me of something.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean Aunt March?\u201d asked her mother, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, to remind me not to be selfish.\u201d Amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to the little plan.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought a great deal lately about my \u2018bundle of naughties\u2019, and being selfish is the largest one in it, so I\u2019m going to try hard to cure it, if I can. Beth isn\u2019t selfish, and that\u2019s the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn\u2019t feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don\u2019t deserve to have them, but I\u2019d like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I\u2019m going to try and be like Beth all I can. I\u2019m apt to forget my resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I guess I should do better. May we try this way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your ring, dear, and do your best. I think you will prosper, for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go back to Beth. Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you home again.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the traveler\u2019s safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth\u2019s room, and finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, deary?\u201d asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a face which invited confidence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to tell you something, Mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout Meg?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow quickly you guessed! Yes, it\u2019s about her, and though it\u2019s a little thing, it fidgets me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBeth is asleep. Speak low, and tell me all about it. That Moffat hasn\u2019t been here, I hope?\u201d asked Mrs. March rather sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I should have shut the door in his face if he had,\u201d said Jo, settling herself on the floor at her mother\u2019s feet. \u201cLast summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences\u2019 and only one was returned. We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn\u2019t dare say so, she was so young and he so poor. Now, isn\u2019t it a dreadful state of things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think Meg cares for him?\u201d asked Mrs. March, with an anxious look.\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy me! I don\u2019t know anything about love and such nonsense!\u201d cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. \u201cIn novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin, and acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort. She eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him to do it, but he doesn\u2019t mind me as he ought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d cried Jo, staring.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brooke. I call him \u2018John\u2019 now. We fell into the way of doing so at the hospital, and he likes it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear! I know you\u2019ll take his part. He\u2019s been good to Father, and you won\u2019t send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to. Mean thing! To go petting Papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into liking him.\u201d And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear, don\u2019t get angry about it, and I will tell you how it happened. John went with me at Mr. Laurence\u2019s request, and was so devoted to poor Father that we couldn\u2019t help getting fond of him. He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent to Meg\u2019s engaging herself so young.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not. It would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing. I felt it, and now it\u2019s worse than I imagined. I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely, \u201cJo, I confide in you and don\u2019t wish you to say anything to Meg yet. When John comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her feelings toward him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will be all up with her. She\u2019s got such a soft heart, it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her. She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn\u2019t think John an ugly name, and she\u2019ll go and fall in love, and there\u2019s an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all! They\u2019ll go lovering around the house, and we shall have to dodge. Meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more. Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off, and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and everything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! Why weren\u2019t we all boys, then there wouldn\u2019t be any bother.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked up with an air of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it, Mother? I\u2019m glad of it. Let\u2019s send him about his business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as we always have been.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as long as I can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for her. Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John love one another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She is conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly. My pretty, tender hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHadn\u2019t you rather have her marry a rich man?\u201d asked Jo, as her mother\u2019s voice faltered a little over the last words.\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should like to know that John was firmly established in some good business, which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable. I\u2019m not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune, but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the possession of a good man\u2019s heart, and that is better than a fortune.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I\u2019m disappointed about Meg, for I\u2019d planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of luxury all her days. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice?\u201d asked Jo, looking up with a brighter face.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is younger than she, you know,\u201d began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in...\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly a little, he\u2019s old for his age, and tall, and can be quite grown-up in his manners if he likes. Then he\u2019s rich and generous and good, and loves us all, and I say it\u2019s a pity my plan is spoiled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on. Don\u2019t make plans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. We can\u2019t meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get \u2018romantic rubbish\u2019 as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I won\u2019t, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten it out. I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens cats, more\u2019s the pity!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that about flatirons and cats?\u201d asked Meg, as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one of my stupid speeches. I\u2019m going to bed. Come, Peggy,\u201d said Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love to John,\u201d said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter and gave it back.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you call him \u2018John\u2019?\u201d asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes looking down into her mother\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,\u201d replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of that, he is so lonely. Good night, Mother, dear. It is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,\u201d was Meg\u2019s answer.\r\n\r\nThe kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, \u201cShe does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\r\nLAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her, and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask. She was rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother. This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long confinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.\r\n\r\nShe was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he knew, then that he didn\u2019t care; and at last, by dint of perseverance, he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor\u2019s confidence, he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.\r\n\r\nMeg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her father\u2019s return, but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike herself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face. To her mother\u2019s inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and Jo\u2019s she silenced by begging to be let alone.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe feels it in the air\u2014love, I mean\u2014and she\u2019s going very fast. She\u2019s got most of the symptoms\u2014is twittery and cross, doesn\u2019t eat, lies awake, and mopes in corners. I caught her singing that song he gave her, and once she said \u2018John\u2019, as you do, and then turned as red as a poppy. Whatever shall we do?\u201d said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however violent.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father\u2019s coming will settle everything,\u201d replied her mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals mine,\u201d said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little post office.\r\n\r\nMrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child, what is it?\u201d cried her mother, running to her, while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a mistake, he didn\u2019t send it. Oh, Jo, how could you do it?\u201d and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite broken.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe! I\u2019ve done nothing! What\u2019s she talking about?\u201d cried Jo, bewildered.\r\n\r\nMeg\u2019s mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, \u201cYou wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note, which was written in a peculiar hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Dearest Margaret,\r\n\r\n\u201cI can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I return. I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr. Laurence will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me happy. I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to,\r\n\r\n\u201cYour devoted John.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the little villain! That\u2019s the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to Mother. I\u2019ll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon,\u201d cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice. But her mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore...\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn my word, Mother, I haven\u2019t! I never saw that note before, and don\u2019t know anything about it, as true as I live!\u201d said Jo, so earnestly that they believed her. \u201cIf I had taken part in it I\u2019d have done it better than this, and have written a sensible note. I should think you\u2019d have known Mr. Brooke wouldn\u2019t write such stuff as that,\u201d she added, scornfully tossing down the paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like his writing,\u201d faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Meg, you didn\u2019t answer it?\u201d cried Mrs. March quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I did!\u201d and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a scrape! Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured. I can\u2019t rest till I get hold of him.\u201d And Jo made for the door again.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret, tell me the whole story,\u201d commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.\r\n\r\n\u201cI received the first letter from Laurie, who didn\u2019t look as if he knew anything about it,\u201d began Meg, without looking up. \u201cI was worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn\u2019t mind if I kept my little secret for a few days. I\u2019m so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such things to do. Forgive me, Mother, I\u2019m paid for my silliness now. I never can look him in the face again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d asked Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n\u201cI only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn\u2019t wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father. I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more, for a long while.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands, exclaiming, with a laugh, \u201cYou are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence! Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo, should take liberties with our names. It\u2019s very kind and respectful, but think how dreadful for me!\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden she stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely, said decidedly, \u201cI don\u2019t believe Brooke ever saw either of these letters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with because I wouldn\u2019t tell him my secret.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t have any secrets, Jo. Tell it to Mother and keep out of trouble, as I should have done,\u201d said Meg warningly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless you, child! Mother told me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do, Jo. I\u2019ll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie. I shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nAway ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke\u2019s real feelings. \u201cNow, dear, what are your own? Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the present?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so scared and worried, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,\u201d answered Meg petulantly. \u201cIf John doesn\u2019t know anything about this nonsense, don\u2019t tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won\u2019t be deceived and plagued and made a fool of. It\u2019s a shame!\u201d\r\n\r\nSeeing Meg\u2019s usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie\u2019s step was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he wouldn\u2019t come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March\u2019s face, and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once. Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened during that interview the girls never knew.\r\n\r\nWhen they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it wise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, and was much comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan\u2019t drag it out of me, so you\u2019ll forgive me, Meg, and I\u2019ll do anything to show how out-and-out sorry I am,\u201d he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn\u2019t think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,\u201d replied Meg, trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was altogether abominable, and I don\u2019t deserve to be spoken to for a month, but you will, though, won\u2019t you?\u201d And Laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior.\r\n\r\nMeg pardoned him, and Mrs. March\u2019s grave face relaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.\r\n\r\nJo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed for Teddy. After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and armed with a book to return, went over to the big house.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Mr. Laurence in?\u201d asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming downstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Miss, but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s seeable just yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not? Is he ill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLa, no Miss, but he\u2019s had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I dursn\u2019t go nigh him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is Laurie?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShut up in his room, and he won\u2019t answer, though I\u2019ve been a-tapping. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s to become of the dinner, for it\u2019s ready, and there\u2019s no one to eat it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and see what the matter is. I\u2019m not afraid of either of them.\u201d\r\n\r\nUp went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie\u2019s little study.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop that, or I\u2019ll open the door and make you!\u201d called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone.\r\n\r\nJo immediately knocked again. The door flew open, and in she bounced before Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly, \u201cPlease forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, and can\u2019t go away till I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Get up, and don\u2019t be a goose, Jo,\u201d was the cavalier reply to her petition.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I will. Could I ask what\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t look exactly easy in your mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been shaken, and I won\u2019t bear it!\u201d growled Laurie indignantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho did it?\u201d demanded Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cGrandfather. If it had been anyone else I\u2019d have...\u201d And the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I often shake you, and you don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Jo soothingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh! You\u2019re a girl, and it\u2019s fun, but I\u2019ll allow no man to shake me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now. Why were you treated so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust because I wouldn\u2019t say what your mother wanted me for. I\u2019d promised not to tell, and of course I wasn\u2019t going to break my word.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I\u2019d have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing Meg in. As I couldn\u2019t, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for fear I should forget myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice, but he\u2019s sorry, I know, so go down and make up. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHanged if I do! I\u2019m not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone, just for a bit of a frolic. I was sorry about Meg, and begged pardon like a man, but I won\u2019t do it again, when I wasn\u2019t in the wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It\u2019s no use, Jo, he\u2019s got to learn that I\u2019m able to take care of myself, and don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s apron string to hold on by.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat pepper pots you are!\u201d sighed Jo. \u201cHow do you mean to settle this affair?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can\u2019t tell him what the fuss\u2019s about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBless you! He won\u2019t do that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t go down till he does.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I\u2019ll explain what I can. You can\u2019t stay here, so what\u2019s the use of being melodramatic?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to stay here long, anyway. I\u2019ll slip off and take a journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he\u2019ll come round fast enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t preach. I\u2019ll go to Washington and see Brooke. It\u2019s gay there, and I\u2019ll enjoy myself after the troubles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat fun you\u2019d have! I wish I could run off too,\u201d said Jo, forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and I\u2019ll stir up old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke. Let\u2019s do it, Jo. We\u2019ll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once. I\u2019ve got money enough. It will do you good, and no harm, as you go to your father.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was, it just suited her. She was tired of care and confinement, longed for change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I was a boy, we\u2019d run away together, and have a capital time, but as I\u2019m a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don\u2019t tempt me, Teddy, it\u2019s a crazy plan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fun of it,\u201d began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d cried Jo, covering her ears. \u201c\u2018Prunes and prisms\u2019 are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had more spirit,\u201d began Laurie insinuatingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don\u2019t go making me add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?\u201d asked Jo seriously.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but you won\u2019t do it,\u201d answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I can manage the young one, I can the old one,\u201d muttered Jo, as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d and Mr. Laurence\u2019s gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as Jo tapped at his door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only me, Sir, come to return a book,\u201d she said blandly, as she entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWant any more?\u201d asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but trying not to show it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I\u2019ll try the second volume,\u201d returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of Boswell\u2019s Johnson, as he had recommended that lively work.\r\n\r\nThe shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced round on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has that boy been about? Don\u2019t try to shield him. I know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. I can\u2019t get a word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word to anyone,\u201d began Jo reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t do. He shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls. If he\u2019s done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo. I won\u2019t be kept in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and brave it out.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, Sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie has confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don\u2019t keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you interfere. Please don\u2019t. It was partly my fault, but it\u2019s all right now. So let\u2019s forget it, and talk about the Rambler or something pleasant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHang the Rambler! Come down and give me your word that this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn\u2019t done anything ungrateful or impertinent. If he has, after all your kindness to him, I\u2019ll thrash him with my own hands.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cHum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and not from obstinacy, I\u2019ll forgive him. He\u2019s a stubborn fellow and hard to manage,\u201d said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king\u2019s horses and all the king\u2019s men couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m not kind to him, hey?\u201d was the sharp answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear no, Sir. You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don\u2019t you think you are?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, \u201cYou\u2019re right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I know how it will end, if we go on so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, he\u2019ll run away.\u201d Jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made. She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.\r\n\r\nMr. Laurence\u2019s ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his table. It was Laurie\u2019s father, who had run away in his youth, and married against the imperious old man\u2019s will. Jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe won\u2019t do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it sometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often think I should like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently taking the whole as a joke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where\u2019s your respect for me, and your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What torments they are, yet we can\u2019t do without them,\u201d he said, pinching her cheeks good-humoredly. \u201cGo and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it\u2019s all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather. I won\u2019t bear it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe won\u2019t come, Sir. He feels badly because you didn\u2019t believe him when he said he couldn\u2019t tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very much.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?\u201d and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d write him an apology, Sir. He says he won\u2019t come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it. He likes fun, and this way is better than talking. I\u2019ll carry it up, and teach him his duty.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying slowly, \u201cYou\u2019re a sly puss, but I don\u2019t mind being managed by you and Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this nonsense.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on the top of Mr. Laurence\u2019s bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under Laurie\u2019s door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of countenance, \u201cWhat a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?\u201d he added, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he was pretty mild, on the whole.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, and I felt just ready to go to the deuce,\u201d he began apologetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my son.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will be an end,\u201d he said dolefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo and eat your dinner, you\u2019ll feel better after it. Men always croak when they are hungry,\u201d and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a \u2018label\u2019 on my \u2018sect\u2019,\u201d answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nEveryone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered. She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her sister\u2019s desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, \u2018Mrs. John Brooke\u2019, whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire, feeling that Laurie\u2019s prank had hastened the evil day for her.\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\r\nPLEASANT MEADOWS\r\n\r\nLike sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time with doll\u2019s sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand. Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for \u2018the dear\u2019, while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.\r\n\r\nAs Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way. After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.\r\n\r\nSeveral days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid Christmas Day. Hannah \u2018felt in her bones\u2019 that it was going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother\u2019s gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.\r\n\r\nTHE JUNGFRAU TO BETH\r\n\r\nGod bless you, dear Queen Bess!\r\nMay nothing you dismay,\r\nBut health and peace and happiness\r\nBe yours, this Christmas day.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s fruit to feed our busy bee,\r\nAnd flowers for her nose.\r\nHere\u2019s music for her pianee,\r\nAn afghan for her toes,\r\n\r\nA portrait of Joanna, see,\r\nBy Raphael No. 2,\r\nWho laboured with great industry\r\nTo make it fair and true.\r\n\r\nAccept a ribbon red, I beg,\r\nFor Madam Purrer\u2019s tail,\r\nAnd ice cream made by lovely Peg,\r\nA Mont Blanc in a pail.\r\n\r\nTheir dearest love my makers laid\r\nWithin my breast of snow.\r\nAccept it, and the Alpine maid,\r\nFrom Laurie and from Jo.\r\n\r\nHow Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I couldn\u2019t hold one drop more,\u201d said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the \u2018Jungfrau\u2019 had sent her.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the long-desired Undine and Sintram.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I am,\u201d echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a pretty frame.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I am!\u201d cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. \u201cHow can I be otherwise?\u201d said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her husband\u2019s letter to Beth\u2019s smiling face, and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her breast.\r\n\r\nNow and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is. Half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, \u201cHere\u2019s another Christmas present for the March family.\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes, leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and couldn\u2019t. Of course there was a general stampede, and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things were done, and no one said a word.\r\n\r\nMr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms. Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet. Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently explained. And Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father\u2019s boots in the most touching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, \u201cHush! Remember Beth.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. The study door flew open, the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and Beth ran straight into her father\u2019s arms. Never mind what happened just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.\r\n\r\nIt was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.\r\n\r\nMr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you to imagine. Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked, rather abruptly, if he wouldn\u2019t like to have something to eat. Jo saw and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, \u201cI hate estimable young men with brown eyes!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned, and decorated. So was the plum pudding, which melted in one\u2019s mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said, \u201cFor my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it\u2019s a merrycle I didn\u2019t roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin\u2019 of it in a cloth.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie\u2019s infinite amusement. Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank healths, told stories, sang songs, \u2018reminisced\u2019, as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected to have. Do you remember?\u201d asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things.\r\n\r\n\u201cRather a pleasant year on the whole!\u201d said Meg, smiling at the fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been a pretty hard one,\u201d observed Amy, watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s over, because we\u2019ve got you back,\u201d whispered Beth, who sat on her father\u2019s knee.\r\n\r\n\u201cRather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially the latter part of it. But you have got on bravely, and I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,\u201d said Mr. March, looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know? Did Mother tell you?\u201d asked Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot much. Straws show which way the wind blows, and I\u2019ve made several discoveries today.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, tell us what they are!\u201d cried Meg, who sat beside him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is one.\u201d And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm. \u201cI remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this seeming blemishes I read a little history. A burnt offering has been made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters, and I\u2019m sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments. I\u2019m proud to shake this good, industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it in the hearty pressure of her father\u2019s hand and the approving smile he gave her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about Jo? Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard and been so very, very good to me,\u201d said Beth in her father\u2019s ear.\r\n\r\nHe laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an unusually mild expression in her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn spite of the curly crop, I don\u2019t see the \u2018son Jo\u2019 whom I left a year ago,\u201d said Mr. March. \u201cI see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower. She doesn\u2019t bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me. I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don\u2019t know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in all Washington I couldn\u2019t find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father\u2019s praise, feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Beth,\u201d said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s so little of her, I\u2019m afraid to say much, for fear she will slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,\u201d began their father cheerfully. But recollecting how nearly he had lost her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own, \u201cI\u2019ve got you safe, my Beth, and I\u2019ll keep you so, please God.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a minute\u2019s silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair...\r\n\r\n\u201cI observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on every one with patience and good humor. I also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures. I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking of, Beth?\u201d asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her father and told about her ring.\r\n\r\n\u201cI read in Pilgrim\u2019s Progress today how, after many troubles, Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey\u2019s end,\u201d answered Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father\u2019s arms and went to the instrument, \u201cIt\u2019s singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I\u2019ll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the music for Father, because he likes the verses.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song for her.\r\n\r\nHe that is down need fear no fall,\r\nHe that is low no pride.\r\nHe that is humble ever shall\r\nHave God to be his guide.\r\n\r\nI am content with what I have,\r\nLittle be it, or much.\r\nAnd, Lord! Contentment still I crave,\r\nBecause Thou savest such.\r\n\r\nFulness to them a burden is,\r\nThat go on pilgrimage.\r\nHere little, and hereafter bliss,\r\nIs best from age to age!\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\r\nAUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION\r\n\r\nLike bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth\u2019s sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then \u2018to peek at the dear man\u2019, nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke\u2019s umbrella, which had been left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John\u2019s name was mentioned. Amy said, \u201cEveryone seemed waiting for something, and couldn\u2019t settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,\u201d and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn\u2019t run over as usual.\r\n\r\nLaurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does the goose mean?\u201d said Meg, laughing and trying to look unconscious.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn\u2019t it?\u201d answered Jo scornfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say my John, it isn\u2019t proper or true,\u201d but Meg\u2019s voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t plague me, Jo, I\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t care much about him, and there isn\u2019t to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t, for something has been said, and Laurie\u2019s mischief has spoiled you for me. I see it, and so does Mother. You are not like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don\u2019t mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all settled. I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly,\u201d said Jo pettishly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say anything till he speaks, and he won\u2019t, because Father said I was too young,\u201d began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he did speak, you wouldn\u2019t know what to say, but would cry or blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided no.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say, for I\u2019ve planned it all, so I needn\u2019t be taken unawares. There\u2019s no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo couldn\u2019t help smiling at the important air which Meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you mind telling me what you\u2019d say?\u201d asked Jo more respectfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant, and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own affairs of this sort.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mean to have any. It\u2019s fun to watch other people philander, but I should feel like a fool doing it myself,\u201d said Jo, looking alarmed at the thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.\u201d Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,\u201d said Jo, rudely shortening her sister\u2019s little reverie.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, \u2018Thank you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young to enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let us be friends as we were.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum, that\u2019s stiff and cool enough! I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll ever say it, and I know he won\u2019t be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the rejected lovers in books, you\u2019ll give in, rather than hurt his feelings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. I shall tell him I\u2019ve made up my mind, and shall walk out of the room with dignity.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood afternoon. I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your father finds himself today,\u201d said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very well, he\u2019s in the rack. I\u2019ll get him, and tell it you are here.\u201d And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity. But the instant she vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring...\r\n\r\n\u201cMother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I\u2019ll call her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?\u201d and Mr. Brooke looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said gratefully...\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish I could thank you for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I tell you how?\u201d asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, please don\u2019t, I\u2019d rather not,\u201d she said, trying to withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t trouble you. I only want to know if you care for me a little, Meg. I love you so much, dear,\u201d added Mr. Brooke tenderly.\r\n\r\nThis was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn\u2019t make it. She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in his most persuasive tone, \u201cWill you try and find out? I want to know so much, for I can\u2019t go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m too young,\u201d faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me. Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot if I chose to learn it, but. . .\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is easier than German,\u201d broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.\r\n\r\nHis tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. This nettled her. Annie Moffat\u2019s foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, \u201cI don\u2019t choose. Please go away and let me be!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it rather bewildered him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you really mean that?\u201d he asked anxiously, following her as she walked away.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do. I don\u2019t want to be worried about such things. Father says I needn\u2019t, it\u2019s too soon and I\u2019d rather not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMayn\u2019t I hope you\u2019ll change your mind by-and-by? I\u2019ll wait and say nothing till you have had more time. Don\u2019t play with me, Meg. I didn\u2019t think that of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think of me at all. I\u2019d rather you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Meg, taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover\u2019s patience and her own power.\r\n\r\nHe was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did. He just stood looking at her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself. What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.\r\n\r\nThe old lady couldn\u2019t resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March\u2019s arrival, drove straight out to see him. The family were all busy in the back part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise them. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless me, what\u2019s all this?\u201d cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Father\u2019s friend. I\u2019m so surprised to see you!\u201d stammered Meg, feeling that she was in for a lecture now.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s evident,\u201d returned Aunt March, sitting down. \u201cBut what is Father\u2019s friend saying to make you look like a peony? There\u2019s mischief going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,\u201d with another rap.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were only talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,\u201d began Meg, wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrooke? That boy\u2019s tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it. Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father\u2019s letters, and I made her tell me. You haven\u2019t gone and accepted him, child?\u201d cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! He\u2019ll hear. Shan\u2019t I call Mother?\u201d said Meg, much troubled.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet. I\u2019ve something to say to you, and I must free my mind at once. Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, not one penny of my money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible girl,\u201d said the old lady impressively.\r\n\r\nNow Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would probably have declared she couldn\u2019t think of it, but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind that she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money to anyone you like,\u201d she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.\r\n\r\n\u201cHighty-tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You\u2019ll be sorry for it by-and-by, when you\u2019ve tried love in a cottage and found it a failure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be a worse one than some people find in big houses,\u201d retorted Meg.\r\n\r\nAunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did not know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she could, \u201cNow, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice. I mean it kindly, and don\u2019t want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning. You ought to marry well and help your family. It\u2019s your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFather and Mother don\u2019t think so. They like John though he is poor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of babies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of it,\u201d cried Meg stoutly.\r\n\r\nAunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. \u201cThis Rook is poor and hasn\u2019t got any rich relations, has he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but he has many warm friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t live on friends, try it and see how cool they\u2019ll grow. He hasn\u2019t any business, has he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet. Mr. Laurence is going to help him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without money, position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better? I thought you had more sense, Meg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise, he\u2019s got heaps of talent, he\u2019s willing to work and sure to get on, he\u2019s so energetic and brave. Everyone likes and respects him, and I\u2019m proud to think he cares for me, though I\u2019m so poor and young and silly,\u201d said Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows you have got rich relations, child. That\u2019s the secret of his liking, I suspect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such meanness, and I won\u2019t listen to you a minute if you talk so,\u201d cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady\u2019s suspicions. \u201cMy John wouldn\u2019t marry for money, any more than I would. We are willing to work and we mean to wait. I\u2019m not afraid of being poor, for I\u2019ve been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him because he loves me, and I...\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn\u2019t made up her mind, that she had told \u2018her John\u2019 to go away, and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.\r\n\r\nAunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl\u2019s happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a willful child, and you\u2019ve lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m disappointed in you, and haven\u2019t spirits to see your father now. Don\u2019t expect anything from me when you are married. Your Mr. Brooke\u2019s friends must take care of you. I\u2019m done with you forever.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd slamming the door in Meg\u2019s face, Aunt March drove off in high dudgeon. She seemed to take all the girl\u2019s courage with her, for when left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry. Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr. Brooke, who said all in one breath, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help hearing, Meg. Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care for me a little bit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how much till she abused you,\u201d began Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I needn\u2019t go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\nHere was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced herself forever in Jo\u2019s eyes by meekly whispering, \u201cYes, John,\u201d and hiding her face on Mr. Brooke\u2019s waistcoat.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes after Aunt March\u2019s departure, Jo came softly downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to herself, \u201cShe has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is settled. I\u2019ll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away. At the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but \u2018that man\u2019, as Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, \u201cSister Jo, congratulate us!\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a word. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room, \u201cOh, do somebody go down quick! John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered it a most agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them, so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles to the rats.\r\n\r\nNobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.\r\n\r\nThe tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both looking so happy that Jo hadn\u2019t the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy was very much impressed by John\u2019s devotion and Meg\u2019s dignity, Beth beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident Aunt March was right in calling them as \u2018unworldly as a pair of babies\u2019. No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?\u201d said Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she was planning to make.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t. How much has happened since I said that! It seems a year ago,\u201d answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the changes have begun,\u201d said Mrs. March. \u201cIn most families there comes, now and then, a year full of events. This has been such a one, but it ends well, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHope the next will end better,\u201d muttered Jo, who found it very hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope the third year from this will end better. I mean it shall, if I live to work out my plans,\u201d said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if everything had become possible to him now.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem very long to wait?\u201d asked Amy, who was in a hurry for the wedding.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short time to me,\u201d answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have only to wait, I am to do the work,\u201d said John beginning his labors by picking up Meg\u2019s napkin, with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged, \u201cHere comes Laurie. Now we shall have some sensible conversation.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for \u2018Mrs. John Brooke\u2019, and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it\u2019s done though the sky falls,\u201d said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his congratulations.\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,\u201d answered Mr. Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come if I\u2019m at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo\u2019s face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don\u2019t look festive, ma\u2019am, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Laurie, following her into a corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t approve of the match, but I\u2019ve made up my mind to bear it, and shall not say a word against it,\u201d said Jo solemnly. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how hard it is for me to give up Meg,\u201d she continued with a little quiver in her voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t give her up. You only go halves,\u201d said Laurie consolingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can never be the same again. I\u2019ve lost my dearest friend,\u201d sighed Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got me, anyhow. I\u2019m not good for much, I know, but I\u2019ll stand by you, Jo, all the days of my life. Upon my word I will!\u201d and Laurie meant what he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you will, and I\u2019m ever so much obliged. You are always a great comfort to me, Teddy,\u201d returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, don\u2019t be dismal, there\u2019s a good fellow. It\u2019s all right you see. Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately, Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her own little house. We\u2019ll have capital times after she is gone, for I shall be through college before long, and then we\u2019ll go abroad on some nice trip or other. Wouldn\u2019t that console you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI rather think it would, but there\u2019s no knowing what may happen in three years,\u201d said Jo thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. Don\u2019t you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then? I do,\u201d returned Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so happy now, I don\u2019t believe they could be much improved.\u201d And Jo\u2019s eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the prospect was a pleasant one.\r\n\r\nFather and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and Laurie, leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both.\r\n\r\nSo the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women.\r\nPART 2\r\n\r\nIn order that we may start afresh and go to Meg\u2019s wedding...\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\r\nGOSSIP\r\n\r\nIn order that we may start afresh and go to Meg\u2019s wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches. And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much \u2018lovering\u2019 in the story, as I fear they may (I\u2019m not afraid the young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March, \u201cWhat can you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a dashing young neighbor over the way?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls all mankind \u2018brother\u2019, the piety that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.\r\n\r\nThese attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel. Sinners told their sins to the pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved. Gifted men found a companion in him. Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own, and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true, although \u2018they wouldn\u2019t pay\u2019.\r\n\r\nTo outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among his books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred words, husband and father.\r\n\r\nThe girls gave their hearts into their mother\u2019s keeping, their souls into their father\u2019s, and to both parents, who lived and labored so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death.\r\n\r\nMrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg\u2019s affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded \u2018boys\u2019 and soldiers\u2019 widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary\u2019s visits.\r\n\r\nJohn Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent home, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars, but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business, and earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence\u2019s more generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money.\r\n\r\nMeg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever, for love is a great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin. Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn\u2019t help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her, and when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie\u2019s splendor and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in Christendom.\r\n\r\nJo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going, and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would have served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again the rosy, healthy creature she had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and serene, and busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone\u2019s friend, and an angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to know it.\r\n\r\nAs long as The Spread Eagle paid her a dollar a column for her \u2018rubbish\u2019, as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun her little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame.\r\n\r\nLaurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent, and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him with all their hearts.\r\n\r\nBeing only \u2018a glorious human boy\u2019, of course he frolicked and flirted, grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified professors, and vanquished enemies. The \u2018men of my class\u2019, were heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of \u2018our fellows\u2019, and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.\r\n\r\nAmy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own element, and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy\u2019s shrine. And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the \u2018Dovecote\u2019.\r\n\r\nThat was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for Meg\u2019s first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who \u2018went on together like a pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo\u2019. It was a tiny house, with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain, shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches, undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted. But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit, and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin. But once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy\u2019s artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever better provided with good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg\u2019s few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over, and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute \u2018Mis. Brooke came home\u2019. I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.\r\n\r\nPeople who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them, and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest, from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was eloquent of home love and tender forethought.\r\n\r\nWhat happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter arose over Laurie\u2019s ridiculous bargains. In his love of jokes, this young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as ever. His last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one\u2019s hands, infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.\r\n\r\nIn vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him \u2018Mr. Toodles\u2019. He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.\r\n\r\nEverything was done at last, even to Amy\u2019s arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth\u2019s setting the table for the first meal.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you should be happy here?\u201d asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so happy that I can\u2019t talk about it,\u201d with a look that was far better than words.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she only had a servant or two it would be all right,\u201d said Amy, coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try her way first. There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick,\u201d answered Meg tranquilly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSallie Moffat has four,\u201d began Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Meg had four, the house wouldn\u2019t hold them, and master and missis would have to camp in the garden,\u201d broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.\r\n\r\n\u201cSallie isn\u2019t a poor man\u2019s wife, and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one. It\u2019s a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her,\u201d said Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did after a while, not to \u2018mess\u2019 but to learn of Hannah how things should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me. It was play then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she wishes to be well and honestly served.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mother, I\u2019m sure of that,\u201d said Meg, listening respectfully to the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping. \u201cDo you know I like this room most of all in my baby house,\u201d added Meg, a minute after, as they went upstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.\r\n\r\nBeth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke, for that linen closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married \u2018that Brooke\u2019 she shouldn\u2019t have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence\u2019s mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen, and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her,\u201d said Mrs. March, patting the damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me all my days, Hannah says.\u201d And Meg looked quite contented, as well she might.\r\n\r\nA tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty...\r\n\r\n\u201cHere I am, Mother! Yes, it\u2019s all right.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker\u2019s congratulations and compliments. Bless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are, Jo. Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth\u2019s hair ribbon, stared at Jo\u2019s big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and everyone began to talk.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is John?\u201d asked Meg anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cStopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich side won the last match, Teddy?\u201d inquired Jo, who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.\r\n\r\n\u201cOurs, of course. Wish you\u2019d been there to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is the lovely Miss Randal?\u201d asked Amy with a significant smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cMore cruel than ever. Don\u2019t you see how I\u2019m pining away?\u201d and Laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the last joke? Undo the bundle and see, Meg,\u201d said Beth, eying the knobby parcel with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,\u201d observed Laurie, as a watchman\u2019s rattle appeared, amid the laughter of the girls.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy. Nice thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d and Laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s gratitude for you! And speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she hadn\u2019t defended it manfully I\u2019d have had a pick at it, for it looked like a remarkably plummy one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,\u201d said Meg in a matronly tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing my best, ma\u2019am, but can\u2019t get much higher, I\u2019m afraid, as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,\u201d responded the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little chandelier.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick-and-span bower, so as I\u2019m tremendously hungry, I propose an adjournment,\u201d he added presently.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things to settle,\u201d said Meg, bustling away.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant\u2019s to get more flowers for tomorrow,\u201d added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, Jo, don\u2019t desert a fellow. I\u2019m in such a state of exhaustion I can\u2019t get home without help. Don\u2019t take off your apron, whatever you do, it\u2019s peculiarly becoming,\u201d said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,\u201d began Jo, as they strolled away together. \u201cYou must promise to behave well, and not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a prank.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t say funny things when we ought to be sober.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never do. You are the one for that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony. I shall certainly laugh if you do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t see me, you\u2019ll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never cry unless for some great affliction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch as fellows going to college, hey?\u201d cut in Laurie, with suggestive laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a peacock. I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week? Pretty amiable?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery. Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he\u2019ll take it?\u201d asked Jo rather sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Jo, do you think I\u2019d look your mother in the face and say \u2018All right\u2019, if it wasn\u2019t?\u201d and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t go and be suspicious. I only want some money,\u201d said Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou spend a great deal, Teddy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBless you, I don\u2019t spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone before I know it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and can\u2019t say \u2018No\u2019 to anyone. We heard about Henshaw and all you did for him. If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,\u201d said Jo warmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he made a mountain out of a molehill. You wouldn\u2019t have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not, but I don\u2019t see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I thought you\u2019d got over the dandy period, but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot. Just now it\u2019s the fashion to be hideous, to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. If it was cheap ugliness, I\u2019d say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I don\u2019t get any satisfaction out of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack, that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and stuffed it into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t lecture any more, there\u2019s a good soul! I have enough all through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I\u2019ll get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you in peace if you\u2019ll only let your hair grow. I\u2019m not aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter,\u201d observed Jo severely.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis unassuming style promotes study, that\u2019s why we adopt it,\u201d returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for quarter-inch-long stubble.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate about Amy. He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about in a most suspicious manner. He\u2019d better nip his little passion in the bud, hadn\u2019t he?\u201d added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone, after a minute\u2019s silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course he had. We don\u2019t want any more marrying in this family for years to come. Mercy on us, what are the children thinking of?\u201d and Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in their teens.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fast age, and I don\u2019t know what we are coming to, ma\u2019am. You are a mere infant, but you\u2019ll go next, Jo, and we\u2019ll be left lamenting,\u201d said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed. I\u2019m not one of the agreeable sort. Nobody will want me, and it\u2019s a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t give anyone a chance,\u201d said Laurie, with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. \u201cYou won\u2019t show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and can\u2019t help showing that he likes it, you treat him as Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold water over him, and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that sort of thing. I\u2019m too busy to be worried with nonsense, and I think it\u2019s dreadful to break up families so. Now don\u2019t say any more about it. Meg\u2019s wedding has turned all our heads, and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I don\u2019t wish to get cross, so let\u2019s change the subject;\u201d and Jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\nWhatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate, \u201cMark my words, Jo, you\u2019ll go next.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\r\nTHE FIRST WEDDING\r\n\r\nThe June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long.\r\n\r\nMeg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have. \u201cI don\u2019t want a fashionable wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart. Her sisters braided up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley, which \u2018her John\u2019 liked best of all the flowers that grew.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn\u2019t crumple your dress,\u201d cried Amy, surveying her with delight when all was done.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don\u2019t mind my dress. I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today,\u201d and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not changed the old.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019m going to tie John\u2019s cravat for him, and then to stay a few minutes with Father quietly in the study,\u201d and Meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest.\r\n\r\nAs the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their best just now.\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with ease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.\r\n\r\nBeth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever. The beautiful, kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one, although it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of \u2018being better soon\u2019.\r\n\r\nAmy is with truth considered \u2018the flower of the family\u2019, for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as attractive to many as beauty itself. Amy\u2019s nose still afflicted her, for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and having a decided chin. These offending features gave character to her whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than ever.\r\n\r\nAll three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood.\r\n\r\nThere were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in, to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon my word, here\u2019s a state of things!\u201d cried the old lady, taking the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her lavender moire with a great rustle. \u201cYou oughtn\u2019t to be seen till the last minute, child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon. I\u2019m too happy to care what anyone says or thinks, and I\u2019m going to have my little wedding just as I like it. John, dear, here\u2019s your hammer.\u201d And away went Meg to help \u2018that man\u2019 in his highly improper employment.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke didn\u2019t even say, \u201cThank you,\u201d but as he stooped for the unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door, with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.\r\n\r\nA crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous exclamation, \u201cJupiter Ammon! Jo\u2019s upset the cake again!\u201d caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived, and \u2018the party came in\u2019, as Beth used to say when a child.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than mosquitoes,\u201d whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and Laurie\u2019s black head towered above the rest.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes,\u201d returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.\r\n\r\nThere was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green arch. Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up. The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn. The bridegroom\u2019s hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies. But Meg looked straight up in her husband\u2019s eyes, and said, \u201cI will!\u201d with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mother\u2019s heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly.\r\n\r\nJo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes. Beth kept her face hidden on her mother\u2019s shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t at all the thing, I\u2019m afraid, but the minute she was fairly married, Meg cried, \u201cThe first kiss for Marmee!\u201d and turning, gave it with her heart on her lips. During the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, \u201cBless you, deary, a hundred times! The cake ain\u2019t hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely.\u201d\r\n\r\nEverybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light. There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried round. No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?\u201d he whispered, \u201cor am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and dispatched the rest to the Soldier\u2019s Home. You know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous way, \u201cI like that! For I\u2019ve seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not made wise by experience, I hope?\u201d and there was an anxious accent in Meg\u2019s voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I give you my word for it. Don\u2019t think too well of me, either, this is not one of my temptations. Being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don\u2019t care for it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn\u2019t like to refuse, you see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life.\u201d\r\n\r\nA demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her power, used it as a woman may for her friend\u2019s good. She did not speak, but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness, and a smile which said, \u201cNo one can refuse me anything today.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her his hand, saying heartily, \u201cI promise, Mrs. Brooke!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you, very, very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I drink \u2018long life to your resolution\u2019, Teddy,\u201d cried Jo, baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him.\r\n\r\nSo the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his life.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within. Meg and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot, when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside!\u201d cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into the ring. But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady, she just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.\r\n\r\nWant of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people began to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you\u2019ll be sorry for it,\u201d said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as he led her to the carriage, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a treasure, young man, see that you deserve it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the prettiest wedding I\u2019ve been to for an age, Ned, and I don\u2019t see why, for there wasn\u2019t a bit of style about it,\u201d observed Mrs. Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.\r\n\r\n\u201cLaurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly satisfied,\u201d said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to gratify you, Sir,\u201d was Laurie\u2019s unusually dutiful reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.\r\n\r\nThe little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say \u2018good-by\u2019, as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love you any the less for loving John so much,\u201d she said, clinging to her mother, with full eyes for a moment. \u201cI shall come every day, Father, and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am married. Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank you all for my happy wedding day. Good-by, good-by!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband\u2019s arm, with her hands full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy face\u2014and so Meg\u2019s married life began.\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\r\nARTISTIC ATTEMPTS\r\n\r\nIt takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity. For a long time there was a lull in the \u2018mud-pie\u2019 business, and she devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable. But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire. Raphael\u2019s face was found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on the head of a beer barrel. A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied kindling for some time.\r\n\r\nFrom fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer, if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio, suggested Murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants, Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor\u2019s shirt or a king\u2019s robe, as the spectator pleased.\r\n\r\nCharcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row, looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good, and Amy\u2019s hair, Jo\u2019s nose, Meg\u2019s mouth, and Laurie\u2019s eyes were pronounced \u2018wonderfully fine\u2019. A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off closet shelves onto people\u2019s heads. Children were enticed in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which quenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity. With much difficulty and some danger she was dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt, at least.\r\n\r\nAfter this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to book \u2018a delicious bit\u2019, composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or \u2018a heavenly mass of clouds\u2019, that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. She sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after \u2018points of sight\u2019, or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called.\r\n\r\nIf \u2018genius is eternal patience\u2019, as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called \u2018high art\u2019.\r\n\r\nShe was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she never became a great artist. Here she succeeded better, for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star. Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. She had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, \u201cIf Amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she\u2019d know exactly what to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of her weaknesses was a desire to move in \u2018our best society\u2019, without being quite sure what the best really was. Money, position, fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not admirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now excluded her.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy lady,\u201d as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,\u201d Amy said, coming in with an important air one day.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, little girl, what is it?\u201d replied her mother, in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained \u2018the baby\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. They are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things they admire in my book. They have been very kind to me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know I am poor, yet they never made any difference.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should they?\u201d and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls called her \u2018Maria Theresa air\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly everyone, so don\u2019t ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when your chickens get pecked by smarter birds. The ugly duckling turned out a swan, you know.\u201d and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit.\r\n\r\nMrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked, \u201cWell, my swan, what is your plan?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river, perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate and ice cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many young ladies are there?\u201d asked her mother, beginning to look sober.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won\u2019t all come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mother, how can you think of such a thing? Not more than six or eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr. Laurence\u2019s cherry-bounce.\u201d (Hannah\u2019s pronunciation of char-a-banc.)\r\n\r\n\u201cAll of this will be expensive, Amy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot very. I\u2019ve calculated the cost, and I\u2019ll pay for it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things, and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we don\u2019t need, and attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t have it as I like, I don\u2019t care to have it at all. I know that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help a little, and I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t if I\u2019m willing to pay for it,\u201d said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into obstinacy.\r\n\r\nMrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I\u2019ll say no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you decide, I\u2019ll do my best to help you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThanks, Mother, you are always so kind.\u201d and away went Amy to lay her plan before her sisters.\r\n\r\nMeg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons. But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don\u2019t care a sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a coupe,\u201d said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!\u201d returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions arose. \u201cThe girls do care for me, and I for them, and there\u2019s a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense. You don\u2019t care to make people like you, to go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I mean to make the most of every chance that comes. You can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it independence, if you like. That\u2019s not my way.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side, while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument. Amy\u2019s definition of Jo\u2019s idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more amiable turn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she regarded as \u2018a nonsensical business\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following Monday was set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor because her week\u2019s work was deranged, and prophesied that \u201cef the washin\u2019 and ironin\u2019 warn\u2019t done reg\u2019lar, nothin\u2019 would go well anywheres\u201d. This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy\u2019s motto was \u2018Nil desperandum\u2019, and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles. To begin with, Hannah\u2019s cooking didn\u2019t turn out well. The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and the chocolate wouldn\u2019t froth properly. Then the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward. Beth got a cold and took to her bed. Meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.\r\n\r\nIf it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday, an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a little, blew a little, and didn\u2019t make up its mind till it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got in order. The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.\r\n\r\nThe lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver would get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights, for the \u2018cherry bounce\u2019 and the broken bridge were her strong points.\r\n\r\nThen came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must fly round and be ready for them,\u201d said Amy, as the sun woke her next morning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting a little stale.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,\u201d said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of placid despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cUse the chicken then, the toughness won\u2019t matter in a salad,\u201d advised his wife.\r\n\r\n\u201cHannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at it. I\u2019m very sorry, Amy,\u201d added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won\u2019t do,\u201d said Amy decidedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I rush into town and demand one?\u201d asked Jo, with the magnanimity of a martyr.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to try me. I\u2019ll go myself,\u201d answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to fail.\r\n\r\nShrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her own forethought.\r\n\r\nAs the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to find out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said, \u201cGood morning, Miss March,\u201d and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie\u2019s most elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress, returned the young man\u2019s greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.\r\n\r\nThey got on excellently, for Amy\u2019s chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and\u2014oh horror!\u2014the lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a Tudor!\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Jove, she\u2019s forgotten her dinner!\u201d cried the unconscious youth, poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s mine,\u201d murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red as her fish.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, really, I beg pardon. It\u2019s an uncommonly fine one, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding.\r\n\r\nAmy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat, and said, laughing, \u201cDon\u2019t you wish you were to have some of the salad he\u2019s going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat it?\u201d\r\n\r\nNow that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind were touched. The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about \u2018the charming young ladies\u2019 diverted his mind from the comical mishap.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he\u2019ll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan\u2019t see them, that\u2019s a comfort,\u201d thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.\r\n\r\nShe did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve o\u2019clock all was ready again. Feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday\u2019s failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the \u2018cherry bounce\u2019, and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the rumble, they\u2019re coming! I\u2019ll go onto the porch and meet them. It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble,\u201d said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word. But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cRun, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,\u201d cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even for a laugh.\r\n\r\nIn came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise. The rest of the family, being of a dramatic turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the merriment which possessed them. The remodeled lunch being gaily partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce), and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when \u2018the party went out\u2019.\r\n\r\nAs she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared, except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo\u2019s mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear,\u201d said her mother, as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I thought,\u201d observed Beth, with unusual warmth.\r\n\r\n\u201cCould you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so much company, and I can\u2019t make such delicious stuff as yours,\u201d asked Meg soberly.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake it all. I\u2019m the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will mold before I can dispose of it,\u201d answered Amy, thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity Laurie isn\u2019t here to help us,\u201d began Jo, as they sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.\r\n\r\nA warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed, \u201csalad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn...\u201d Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the \u2018history of salads\u2019, to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cBundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels. Germans like messes. I\u2019m sick of the sight of this, and there\u2019s no reason you should all die of a surfeit because I\u2019ve been a fool,\u201d cried Amy, wiping her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,\u201d sighed Jo, quite spent with laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to satisfy you,\u201d said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am satisfied. I\u2019ve done what I undertook, and it\u2019s not my fault that it failed. I comfort myself with that,\u201d said Amy with a little quiver in her voice. \u201cI thank you all very much for helping me, and I\u2019ll thank you still more if you won\u2019t allude to it for a month, at least.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo one did for several months, but the word \u2018fete\u2019 always produced a general smile, and Laurie\u2019s birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\r\nLITERARY LESSONS\r\n\r\nFortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her path. Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her in this wise.\r\n\r\nEvery few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her scribbling suit, and \u2018fall into a vortex\u2019, as she expressed it, writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was finished she could find no peace. Her \u2018scribbling suit\u2019 consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, \u201cDoes genius burn, Jo?\u201d They did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that hard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and cast upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew, and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow, did anyone dare address Jo.\r\n\r\nShe did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh. Sleep forsook her eyes, meals stood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth living, even if they bore no other fruit. The divine afflatus usually lasted a week or two, and then she emerged from her \u2018vortex\u2019, hungry, sleepy, cross, or despondent.\r\n\r\nShe was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea. It was a People\u2019s Course, the lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.\r\n\r\nThey were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the seat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads and bonnets to match, discussing Women\u2019s Rights and making tatting. Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On her right, her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a newspaper.\r\n\r\nIt was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her, idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume, tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half his paper, saying bluntly, \u201cwant to read it? That\u2019s a first-rate story.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love, mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author\u2019s invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrime, isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked the boy, as her eye went down the last paragraph of her portion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,\u201d returned Jo, amused at his admiration of the trash.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good living out of such stories, they say.\u201d and he pointed to the name of Mrs. S.L.A.N.G. Northbury, under the title of the tale.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know her?\u201d asked Jo, with sudden interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is printed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?\u201d and Jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page.\r\n\r\n\u201cGuess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well for writing it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper, and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its columns for a sensational story. By the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not the first founded on paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when \u2018genius took to burning\u2019. Jo had never tried this style before, contenting herself with very mild romances for The Spread Eagle. Her experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement. The manuscript was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if the tale didn\u2019t get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect, she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.\r\n\r\nSix weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap. For a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry. If the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature, I think he would devote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo valued the letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.\r\n\r\nA prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won the prize. Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story came everyone read and praised it, though after her father had told her that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly way...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never mind the money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the money is the best part of it. What will you do with such a fortune?\u201d asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a reverential eye.\r\n\r\n\u201cSend Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,\u201d answered Jo promptly.\r\n\r\nTo the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn\u2019t come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better, while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger. So Jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the house, for by the magic of a pen, her \u2018rubbish\u2019 turned into comforts for them all. The Duke\u2019s Daughter paid the butcher\u2019s bill, A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.\r\n\r\nWealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the world. Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.\r\n\r\nLittle notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and fortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she particularly admired.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can for it. Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject,\u201d said Jo, calling a family council.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know, and the idea is well worked out. Let it wait and ripen,\u201d was her father\u2019s advice, and he practiced what he preached, having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by waiting,\u201d said Mrs. March. \u201cCriticism is the best test of such work, for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her to do better next time. We are too partial, but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Jo, knitting her brows, \u201cthat\u2019s just it. I\u2019ve been fussing over the thing so long, I really don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s good, bad, or indifferent. It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave a word out of it. You\u2019ll spoil it if you do, for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people, and it will be all a muddle if you don\u2019t explain as you go on,\u201d said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Allen says, \u2018Leave out the explanations, make it brief and dramatic, and let the characters tell the story\u2019,\u201d interrupted Jo, turning to the publisher\u2019s note.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo as he tells you. He knows what will sell, and we don\u2019t. Make a good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when you\u2019ve got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels,\u201d said Amy, who took a strictly practical view of the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Jo, laughing, \u201cif my people are \u2018philosophical and metaphysical\u2019, it isn\u2019t my fault, for I know nothing about such things, except what I hear father say, sometimes. If I\u2019ve got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me. Now, Beth, what do you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should so like to see it printed soon,\u201d was all Beth said, and smiled in saying it. But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike candor, which chilled Jo\u2019s heart for a minute with a forboding fear, and decided her to make her little venture \u2018soon\u2019.\r\n\r\nSo, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. In the hope of pleasing everyone, she took everyone\u2019s advice, and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody.\r\n\r\nHer father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about it. Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description. Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story. Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the story. Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into the big, busy world to try its fate.\r\n\r\nWell, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it, likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou said, Mother, that criticism would help me. But how can it, when it\u2019s so contradictory that I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ve written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments?\u201d cried poor Jo, turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next. \u201cThis man says, \u2018An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.\u2019 \u2018All is sweet, pure, and healthy.\u2019\u201d continued the perplexed authoress. \u201cThe next, \u2018The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.\u2019 Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don\u2019t believe in Spiritualism, and copied my characters from life, I don\u2019t see how this critic can be right. Another says, \u2018It\u2019s one of the best American novels which has appeared for years.\u2019 (I know better than that), and the next asserts that \u2018Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is a dangerous book.\u2019 \u2019Tisn\u2019t! Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money. I wish I\u2019d printed the whole or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally. Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so well and had apparently done so ill. But it did her good, for those whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an author\u2019s best education, and when the first soreness was over, she could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot being a genius, like Keats, it won\u2019t kill me,\u201d she said stoutly, \u201cand I\u2019ve got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd, and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced \u2018charmingly natural, tender, and true\u2019. So I\u2019ll comfort myself with that, and when I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll up again and take another.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\r\nDOMESTIC EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\nLike most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper. John should find home a paradise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously every day, and never know the loss of a button. She brought so much love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed, in spite of some obstacles. Her paradise was not a tranquil one, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares. She was too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare. As for buttons, she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself, and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better than hers.\r\n\r\nThey were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn\u2019t live on love alone. John did not find Meg\u2019s beauty diminished, though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot. Nor did Meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, \u201cShall I send some veal or mutton for dinner, darling?\u201d The little house ceased to be a glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better. At first they played keep-house, and frolicked over it like children. Then John took steadily to business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders, and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.\r\n\r\nWhile the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius\u2019s Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the problems with patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little Hummels. An evening with John over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. Before the golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.\r\n\r\nFired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once. As John firmly believed that \u2018my wife\u2019 was equal to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use. Home came four dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for her. With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her success, for hadn\u2019t she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling, straining, and fussing over her jelly. She did her best, she asked advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but that dreadful stuff wouldn\u2019t \u2018jell\u2019.\r\n\r\nShe longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand, but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with their private worries, experiments, or quarrels. They had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one, but they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had advised the plan. So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day, and at five o\u2019clock sat down in her topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept.\r\n\r\nNow, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, \u201cMy husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he likes. I shall always be prepared. There shall be no flurry, no scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good dinner. John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you please, and be sure of a welcome from me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride to hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior wife. But, although they had had company from time to time, it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now. It always happens so in this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.\r\n\r\nIf John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. Congratulating himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty wife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband.\r\n\r\nIt is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached the Dovecote. The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday\u2019s mud still adorned the steps. The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest. Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a sanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid something has happened. Step into the garden, Scott, while I look up Mrs. Brooke,\u201d said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.\r\n\r\nRound the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face. He paused discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he could both see and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen reigned confusion and despair. One edition of jelly was trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was burning gaily on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat sobbing dismally.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest girl, what is the matter?\u201d cried John, rushing in, with awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried! I\u2019ve been at it till I\u2019m all worn out. Do come and help me or I shall die!\u201d and the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat worries you dear? Has anything dreadful happened?\u201d asked the anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was all askew.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d sobbed Meg despairingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me quick, then. Don\u2019t cry. I can bear anything better than that. Out with it, love.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe... The jelly won\u2019t jell and I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg\u2019s woe.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that all? Fling it out of the window, and don\u2019t bother any more about it. I\u2019ll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t have hysterics, for I\u2019ve brought Jack Scott home to dinner, and...\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...\r\n\r\n\u201cA man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how could you do such a thing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, he\u2019s in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can\u2019t be helped now,\u201d said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to have remembered how busy I was,\u201d continued Meg petulantly, for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for I met him on the way out. I never thought of asking leave, when you have always told me to do as I liked. I never tried it before, and hang me if I ever do again!\u201d added John, with an aggrieved air.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should hope not! Take him away at once. I can\u2019t see him, and there isn\u2019t any dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I like that! Where\u2019s the beef and vegetables I sent home, and the pudding you promised?\u201d cried John, rushing to the larder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t time to cook anything. I meant to dine at Mother\u2019s. I\u2019m sorry, but I was so busy,\u201d and Meg\u2019s tears began again.\r\n\r\nJohn was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day\u2019s work to come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or manner. He restrained himself however, and the little squall would have blown over, but for one unlucky word.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we\u2019ll pull through and have a good time yet. Don\u2019t cry, dear, but just exert yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat. We\u2019re both as hungry as hunters, so we shan\u2019t mind what it is. Give us the cold meat, and bread and cheese. We won\u2019t ask for jelly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his fate. Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure, and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must get yourself out of the scrape as you can. I\u2019m too used up to \u2018exert\u2019 myself for anyone. It\u2019s like a man to propose a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company. I won\u2019t have anything of the sort in my house. Take that Scott up to Mother\u2019s, and tell him I\u2019m away, sick, dead, anything. I won\u2019t see him, and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like. You won\u2019t have anything else here.\u201d and having delivered her defiance all on one breath, Meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room.\r\n\r\nWhat those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but Mr. Scott was not taken \u2018up to Mother\u2019s\u2019, and when Meg descended, after they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror. Lotty reported that they had eaten \u201ca much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff, and hide the pots.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own short-comings, of loyalty to John, \u201cwho might be cruel, but nobody should know it,\u201d restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up, she dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be forgiven.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, John didn\u2019t come, not seeing the matter in that light. He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had deserted him in his hour of need. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied. No, by George, it wasn\u2019t! And Meg must know it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over him. \u201cPoor little thing! It was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me. She was wrong, of course, but then she was young. I must be patient and teach her.\u201d He hoped she had not gone home\u2014he hated gossip and interference. For a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace, resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse.\r\n\r\nMeg likewise resolved to be \u2018calm and kind, but firm\u2019, and show him his duty. She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally, as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.\r\n\r\nJohn was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly relevant remark, \u201cWe are going to have a new moon, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no objection,\u201d was Meg\u2019s equally soothing remark. A few other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished. John went to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it, figuratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither spoke. Both looked quite \u2018calm and firm\u2019, and both felt desperately uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d thought Meg, \u201cmarried life is very trying, and does need infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.\u201d The word \u2018Mother\u2019 suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with unbelieving protests.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see and bear with them, remembering your own. He is very decided, but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. He is very accurate, and particular about the truth\u2014a good trait, though you call him \u2018fussy\u2019. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg, and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need. He has a temper, not like ours\u2014one flash and then all over\u2014but the white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to quench. Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. Watch yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset, especially the last. This was the first serious disagreement, her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart. She glanced at him with tears in her eyes, but he did not see them. She put down her work and got up, thinking, \u201cI will be the first to say, \u2018Forgive me\u2019\u201d, but he did not seem to hear her. She went very slowly across the room, for pride was hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head. For a minute she felt as if she really couldn\u2019t do it, then came the thought, \u201cThis is the beginning. I\u2019ll do my part, and have nothing to reproach myself with,\u201d and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the forehead. Of course that settled it. The penitent kiss was better than a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying tenderly...\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me, dear. I never will again!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family peace was preserved in that little family jar.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the way home.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg. Sallie Moffat renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house, or inviting \u2018that poor dear\u2019 to come in and spend the day at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often felt lonely. All were busy at home, John absent till night, and nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about. So it naturally fell out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend. Seeing Sallie\u2019s pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself because she had not got them. Sallie was very kind, and often offered her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John wouldn\u2019t like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what John disliked even worse.\r\n\r\nShe knew her husband\u2019s income, and she loved to feel that he trusted her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value more\u2014his money. She knew where it was, was free to take what she liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man\u2019s wife. Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without fear. But that autumn the serpent got into Meg\u2019s paradise, and tempted her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress. Meg didn\u2019t like to be pitied and made to feel poor. It irritated her, but she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn\u2019t think she had to economize. She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn\u2019t worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.\r\n\r\nBut the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her. John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg never forgot it. A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and it weighed upon her conscience. Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg longed for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls. Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year\u2019s. That was only a month to wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had the money, if she only dared to take it. John always said what was his was hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund? That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely, shimmering folds, and said, \u201cA bargain, I assure, you, ma\u2019am.\u201d She answered, \u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something, and the police were after her.\r\n\r\nWhen she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn\u2019t become her, after all, and the words \u2018fifty dollars\u2019 seemed stamped like a pattern down each breadth. She put it away, but it haunted her, not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid. When John got out his books that night, Meg\u2019s heart sank, and for the first time in her married life, she was afraid of her husband. The kind, brown eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had found her out, but didn\u2019t mean to let her know it. The house bills were all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was undoing the old pocketbook which they called the \u2018bank\u2019, when Meg, knowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen my private expense book yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing so, and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a bonnet, and cost six dollars. That night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent wife.\r\n\r\nThe little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic increasing with every word...\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn, dear, I\u2019m ashamed to show you my book, for I\u2019ve really been dreadfully extravagant lately. I go about so much I must have things, you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and my New Year\u2019s money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I had done it, for I knew you\u2019d think it wrong in me.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly, \u201cDon\u2019t go and hide. I won\u2019t beat you if you have got a pair of killing boots. I\u2019m rather proud of my wife\u2019s feet, and don\u2019t mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat had been one of her last \u2018trifles\u2019, and John\u2019s eye had fallen on it as he spoke. \u201cOh, what will he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars!\u201d thought Meg, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than boots, it\u2019s a silk dress,\u201d she said, with the calmness of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, dear, what is the \u2018dem\u2019d total\u2019, as Mr. Mantalini says?\u201d\r\n\r\nThat didn\u2019t sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now. She turned the page and her head at the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added. For a minute the room was very still, then John said slowly\u2014but she could feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure\u2014. . .\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t made or trimmed,\u201d sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman, but I\u2019ve no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat\u2019s when she gets it on,\u201d said John dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you are angry, John, but I can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t mean to waste your money, and I didn\u2019t think those little things would count up so. I can\u2019t resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and pitying me because I don\u2019t. I try to be contented, but it is hard, and I\u2019m tired of being poor.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many pleasures for Meg\u2019s sake. She could have bitten her tongue out the minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up, saying with a little quiver in his voice, \u201cI was afraid of this. I do my best, Meg.\u201d If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not have broken her heart like those few words. She ran to him and held him close, crying, with repentant tears, \u201cOh, John, my dear, kind, hard-working boy. I didn\u2019t mean it! It was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach, but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again. She had promised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had reproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings recklessly. It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep. A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the discovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold. He had simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, \u201cI can\u2019t afford it, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would break.\r\n\r\nThey had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him, given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved.\r\n\r\nNext day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor. The good-natured Mrs. Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new silk gown. One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his present, and what a blissful state of things ensued. John came home early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife. So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to Meg a new experience, the deepest and tenderest of a woman\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nLaurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday, with an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, for Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s the little mamma? Where is everybody? Why didn\u2019t you tell me before I came home?\u201d began Laurie in a loud whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cHappy as a queen, the dear! Every soul of \u2019em is upstairs a worshipin\u2019. We didn\u2019t want no hurrycanes round. Now you go into the parlor, and I\u2019ll send \u2019em down to you,\u201d with which somewhat involved reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.\r\n\r\nPresently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow. Jo\u2019s face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.\r\n\r\n\u201cShut your eyes and hold out your arms,\u201d she said invitingly.\r\n\r\nLaurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture. \u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019d rather not. I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you shan\u2019t see your nevvy,\u201d said Jo decidedly, turning as if to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, I will! Only you must be responsible for damages.\u201d and obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms. A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah, and John caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself invested with two babies instead of one.\r\n\r\nNo wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwins, by Jupiter!\u201d was all he said for a minute, then turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added, \u201cTake \u2019em quick, somebody! I\u2019m going to laugh, and I shall drop \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm, as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending, while Laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best joke of the season, isn\u2019t it? I wouldn\u2019t have told you, for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I\u2019ve done it,\u201d said Jo, when she got her breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never was more staggered in my life. Isn\u2019t it fun? Are they boys? What are you going to name them? Let\u2019s have another look. Hold me up, Jo, for upon my life it\u2019s one too many for me,\u201d returned Laurie, regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoy and girl. Aren\u2019t they beauties?\u201d said the proud papa, beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?\u201d and Laurie bent like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French fashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes and one brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,\u201d said wicked Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid they mightn\u2019t like it,\u201d began Laurie, with unusual timidity in such matters.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course they will, they are used to it now. Do it this minute, sir!\u201d commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.\r\n\r\nLaurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, I knew they didn\u2019t like it! That\u2019s the boy, see him kick, he hits out with his fists like a good one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you?\u201d cried Laurie, delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother and grandmother. We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have two Megs, and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name,\u201d said Amy, with aunt-like interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cName him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short,\u201d said Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cDaisy and Demi, just the thing! I knew Teddy would do it,\u201d cried Jo clapping her hands.\r\n\r\nTeddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were \u2018Daisy\u2019 and \u2018Demi\u2019 to the end of the chapter.\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\r\nCALLS\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, Jo, it\u2019s time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don\u2019t think I ever was mad enough to say I\u2019d make six calls in one day, when a single one upsets me for a week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you did, it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the crayon of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our neighbors\u2019 visits.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter of my bond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east, it\u2019s not fair, and I don\u2019t go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s shirking. It\u2019s a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you pride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for she was mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain, bribe, or promise. In the present instance there was no escape, and having clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she smelled thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don\u2019t intend to make calls in that state, I hope,\u201d cried Amy, surveying her with amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not? I\u2019m neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes than they do for me, I don\u2019t wish to see them. You can dress for both, and be as elegant as you please. It pays for you to be fine. It doesn\u2019t for me, and furbelows only worry me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear!\u201d sighed Amy, \u201cnow she\u2019s in a contrary fit, and will drive me distracted before I can get her properly ready. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s no pleasure to me to go today, but it\u2019s a debt we owe society, and there\u2019s no one to pay it but you and me. I\u2019ll do anything for you, Jo, if you\u2019ll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil. You can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so beautifully, if you try, that I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019m afraid to go alone, do come and take care of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way. The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred, and your being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don\u2019t know which is the most absurd. Well, I\u2019ll go if I must, and do my best. You shall be commander of the expedition, and I\u2019ll obey blindly, will that satisfy you?\u201d said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and I\u2019ll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good impression. I want people to like you, and they would if you\u2019d only try to be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the pretty way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet. It\u2019s becoming, and you look too sober in your plain suit. Take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief. We\u2019ll stop at Meg\u2019s, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can have my dove-colored one.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of countenance, saying meekly...\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I die happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re highly satisfactory. Turn slowly round, and let me get a careful view.\u201d Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, \u201cYes, you\u2019ll do. Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing. Hold back your shoulders, and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch. There\u2019s one thing you can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl. I can\u2019t, but it\u2019s very nice to see you, and I\u2019m so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one. It\u2019s simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose isn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,\u201d said Jo, looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair. \u201cAm I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it up, please, ma\u2019am?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house. The sweeping style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully. You haven\u2019t half buttoned one cuff, do it at once. You\u2019ll never look finished if you are not careful about the little details, for they make up the pleasing whole.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as \u2018pretty as picters\u2019, Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window to watch them.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so I want you to put on your best deportment. Don\u2019t make any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be calm, cool, and quiet, that\u2019s safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes,\u201d said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see. \u2018Calm, cool, and quiet\u2019, yes, I think I can promise that. I\u2019ve played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I\u2019ll try it off. My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy in your mind, my child.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as silent as the sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her \u2018charming novel\u2019, and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera, and the fashions. Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a demure \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d with the chill on. In vain Amy telegraphed the word \u2018talk\u2019, tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment like Maud\u2019s face, \u2018icily regular, splendidly null\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!\u201d was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door closed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone. Try to be sociable at the Lambs\u2019. Gossip as other girls do, and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up. They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to know, and I wouldn\u2019t fail to make a good impression there for anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be agreeable. I\u2019ll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like. I rather enjoy this, and now I\u2019ll imitate what is called \u2018a charming girl\u2019. I can do it, for I have May Chester as a model, and I\u2019ll improve upon her. See if the Lambs don\u2019t say, \u2018What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop. Amy\u2019s face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to hear a long account of Lucretia\u2019s last attack, while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her. So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the lady. A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun. One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe rides splendidly. Who taught her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one. She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree. Now she rides anything, for she doesn\u2019t know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well. She has such a passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails, she can be a horsebreaker, and get her living so.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which was her especial aversion. But what could she do? For the old lady was in the middle of her story, and long before it was done, Jo was off again, making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful blunders.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone, and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich did she choose?\u201d asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who enjoyed the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of them. She heard of a young horse at the farm house over the river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try, because he was handsome and spirited. Her struggles were really pathetic. There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she took the saddle to the horse. My dear creature, she actually rowed it over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid she ride the horse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course she did, and had a capital time. I expected to see her brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the life of the party.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I call that plucky!\u201d and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nShe was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress. One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness, \u201cOh, Amy painted it. You can\u2019t buy those soft shades, so we paint ours any color we like. It\u2019s a great comfort to have an artistic sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that an original idea?\u201d cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There\u2019s nothing the child can\u2019t do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for Sallie\u2019s party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,\u201d added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister\u2019s accomplishments that exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,\u201d observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady, who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.\r\n\r\nAny mention of her \u2018works\u2019 always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque remark, as now. \u201cSorry you could find nothing better to read. I write that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you going to New York this winter?\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Miss Lamb had \u2018enjoyed\u2019 the story, this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake, but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their mouths.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmy, we must go. Good-by, dear, do come and see us. We are pining for a visit. I don\u2019t dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you should come, I don\u2019t think I shall have the heart to send you away.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester\u2019s gushing style that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time.\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I do well?\u201d asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing could have been worse,\u201d was Amy\u2019s crushing reply. \u201cWhat possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it\u2019s no use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven\u2019t a bit of proper pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak,\u201d said Amy despairingly.\r\n\r\nPoor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow shall I behave here?\u201d she asked, as they approached the third mansion.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as you please. I wash my hands of you,\u201d was Amy\u2019s short answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we\u2019ll have a comfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution,\u201d returned Jo gruffly, being disturbed by her failure to suit.\r\n\r\nAn enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing. She listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that \u201cTom Brown was a brick,\u201d regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired Frenchwoman.\r\n\r\nLeaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her heart\u2019s content. Mr. Tudor\u2019s uncle had married an English lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of us\u2014that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of March.\r\n\r\nIt might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad. For Jo sat on the grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related one of Laurie\u2019s pranks to her admiring audience. One small child was poking turtles with Amy\u2019s cherished parasol, a second was eating gingerbread over Jo\u2019s best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come again, \u201cIt was such fun to hear about Laurie\u2019s larks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCapital boys, aren\u2019t they? I feel quite young and brisk again after that.\u201d said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?\u201d asked Amy, wisely refraining from any comment upon Jo\u2019s dilapidated appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father, and doesn\u2019t speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast, and I don\u2019t consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I let him alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod, and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain, whose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod and the bow, it would have been right,\u201d said Amy reprovingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d returned Jo, \u201cI neither like, respect, nor admire Tudor, though his grandfather\u2019s uncle\u2019s nephew\u2019s niece was a third cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever. I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use trying to argue with you,\u201d began Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the least, my dear,\u201d interrupted Jo, \u201cso let us look amiable, and drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I\u2019m deeply grateful.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being told that the young ladies were engaged.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today. We can run down there any time, and it\u2019s really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself, if you please. Aunt March likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. It\u2019s a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don\u2019t believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them. Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a good girl you are, Amy!\u201d said Jo, with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and spotless still. \u201cI wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you. I think of them, but it takes too much time to do them, so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip, but they tell best in the end, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air, \u201cWomen should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you\u2019d remember that, and practice it, you\u2019d be better liked than I am, because there is more of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I\u2019m willing to own that you are right, only it\u2019s easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don\u2019t feel like it. It\u2019s a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a greater not to be able to hide them. I don\u2019t mind saying that I don\u2019t approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I\u2019m not called upon to tell him so. Neither are you, and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I\u2019ve had Teddie to manage. But there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word, and I say we ought to do it to others if we can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTeddy is a remarkable boy, and can\u2019t be taken as a sample of other boys,\u201d said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have convulsed the \u2018remarkable boy\u2019 if he had heard it. \u201cIf we were belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don\u2019t approve of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn\u2019t have a particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and puritanical.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That\u2019s a nice sort of morality.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t argue about it, I only know that it\u2019s the way of the world, and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains. I don\u2019t like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on without them. We can\u2019t agree about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. You will get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, compose yourself now, and don\u2019t worry Aunt with your new ideas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to, but I\u2019m always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her. It\u2019s my doom, and I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind. This amiable spirit was felt at once, and both aunts \u2018my deared\u2019 her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically, \u201cThat child improves every day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to help about the fair, dear?\u201d asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d put in Jo decidedly. \u201cI hate to be patronized, and the Chesters think it\u2019s a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am willing to work. It\u2019s for the freedmen as well as the Chesters, and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun. Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It\u2019s a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts. Some do not, and that is trying,\u201d observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.\r\n\r\nIf Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but unfortunately, we don\u2019t have windows in our breasts, and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends. Better for us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave. I\u2019d rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAhem!\u201d coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you so,\u201d said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.\r\n\r\nMercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you speak French, dear?\u201d asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often as I like,\u201d replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old lady to smile affably.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you about languages?\u201d asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know a word. I\u2019m very stupid about studying anything, can\u2019t bear French, it\u2019s such a slippery, silly sort of language,\u201d was the brusque reply.\r\n\r\nAnother look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy, \u201cYou are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe? Eyes don\u2019t trouble you any more, do they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, thank you, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m very well, and mean to do great things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that joyful time arrives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood girl! You deserve to go, and I\u2019m sure you will some day,\u201d said Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her ball for her.\r\n\r\nCrosspatch, draw the latch,\r\nSit by the fire and spin,\r\n\r\nsqualled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into Jo\u2019s face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost observing bird,\u201d said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome and take a walk, my dear?\u201d cried Polly, hopping toward the china closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I will. Come Amy.\u201d and Jo brought the visit to an end, feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution. She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March to say, as they vanished...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better do it, Mary. I\u2019ll supply the money.\u201d and Aunt Carrol to reply decidedly, \u201cI certainly will, if her father and mother consent.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY\r\nCONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\nMrs. Chester\u2019s fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the matter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily. The \u2018haughty, uninteresting creature\u2019 was let severely alone, but Amy\u2019s talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it.\r\n\r\nEverything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young, with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.\r\n\r\nMay Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy\u2019s dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May\u2019s painted vases\u2014that was one thorn. Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at a late party and only once with May\u2014that was thorn number two. But the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs\u2019. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and Amy\u2019s dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look...\r\n\r\n\u201cI find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls. As this is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take this place. I\u2019m sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have another table if you like.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy\u2019s unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble.\r\n\r\nAmy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did, \u201cPerhaps you had rather I took no table at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear, don\u2019t have any ill feeling, I beg. It\u2019s merely a matter of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this table is considered their proper place. I think it very appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn\u2019t you like the flower table? The little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEspecially to gentlemen,\u201d added May, with a look which enlightened Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She colored angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with unexpected amiability...\r\n\r\n\u201cIt shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I\u2019ll give up my place here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,\u201d began May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly...\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, if they are in your way,\u201d and sweeping her contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow she\u2019s mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn\u2019t asked you to speak, Mama,\u201d said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.\r\n\r\n\u201cGirls\u2019 quarrels are soon over,\u201d returned her mother, feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.\r\n\r\nThe little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. But everything seemed against her. It was late, and she was tired. Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn\u2019t stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled. Her best tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid\u2019s cheek. She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.\r\n\r\nThere was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done right. Beth declared she wouldn\u2019t go to the fair at all, and Jo demanded why she didn\u2019t take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things, and though I think I\u2019ve a right to be hurt, I don\u2019t intend to show it. They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions, won\u2019t they, Marmee?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right spirit, my dear. A kiss for a blow is always best, though it\u2019s not very easy to give it sometimes,\u201d said her mother, with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practicing.\r\n\r\nIn spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate, Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers, were the words, \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ought, but I don\u2019t,\u201d thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright page to May\u2019s discontented face behind the big vases, that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street, school, office, or home. Even a fair table may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season. Amy\u2019s conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do, took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.\r\n\r\nA group of girls were standing about May\u2019s table, admiring the pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She heard May say sorrowfully...\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don\u2019t want to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then. Now it\u2019s spoiled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say she\u2019d put them back if you asked her,\u201d suggested someone.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could I after all the fuss?\u201d began May, but she did not finish, for Amy\u2019s voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was just thinking I\u2019d offer to put them back, for they belong to your table rather than mine. Here they are, please take them, and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, I call that lovely of her, don\u2019t you?\u201d cried one girl.\r\n\r\nMay\u2019s answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable laugh, \u201cVery lovely, for she knew she wouldn\u2019t sell them at her own table.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, that was hard. When we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.\r\n\r\nIt was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon. Few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long before night.\r\n\r\nThe art table was the most attractive in the room. There was a crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom.\r\n\r\nShe did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea. Beth helped her dress, and made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything rude, pray Jo; I won\u2019t have any fuss made, so let it all pass and behave yourself,\u201d begged Amy, as she departed early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we\u2019ll have a good time yet.\u201d returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. Presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that my boy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs sure as this is my girl!\u201d and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Teddy, such doings!\u201d and Jo told Amy\u2019s wrongs with sisterly zeal.\r\n\r\n\u201cA flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I\u2019ll be hanged if I don\u2019t make them buy every flower she\u2019s got, and camp down before her table afterward,\u201d said Laurie, espousing her cause with warmth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not arrive in time. I don\u2019t wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I shouldn\u2019t wonder if they never came at all. When people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another,\u201d observed Jo in a disgusted tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was poorly, I didn\u2019t like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are just as much yours as mine. Don\u2019t we always go halves in everything?\u201d began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.\r\n\r\n\u201cGracious, I hope not! Half of some of your things wouldn\u2019t suit me at all. But we mustn\u2019t stand philandering here. I\u2019ve got to help Amy, so you go and make yourself splendid, and if you\u2019ll be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I\u2019ll bless you forever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you do it now?\u201d asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the bars, \u201cGo away, Teddy, I\u2019m busy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a lovely basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece. Then the March family turned out en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy\u2019s taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room. Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.\r\n\r\nJo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the Hall, picking up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of the Chester change of base. She reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible. She also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and considered her a model of magnanimity. As she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister\u2019s things, but saw no sign of them. \u201cTucked away out of sight, I dare say,\u201d thought Jo, who could forgive her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?\u201d asked May with a conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be generous.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is enjoying herself. The flower table is always attractive, you know, \u2018especially to gentlemen\u2019.\u201d Jo couldn\u2019t resist giving that little slap, but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising the great vases, which still remained unsold.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Amy\u2019s illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy that for Father,\u201d said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister\u2019s work.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything of Amy\u2019s sold long ago. I took care that the right people saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,\u201d returned May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had, that day.\r\n\r\nMuch gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of May\u2019s word and manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,\u201d she said, ordering out \u2018Teddy\u2019s own\u2019, as the girls called the college friends.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Charge, Chester, charge!\u2019 is the motto for that table, but do your duty like men, and you\u2019ll get your money\u2019s worth of art in every sense of the word,\u201d said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,\u201d said little Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, my son, for a small boy!\u201d and walked him off, with a paternal pat on the head.\r\n\r\n\u201cBuy the vases,\u201d whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals of fire on her enemy\u2019s head.\r\n\r\nTo May\u2019s great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but pervaded the hall with one under each arm. The other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.\r\n\r\nAunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later.\r\n\r\nThe fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, she did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look which said \u2018forgive and forget\u2019. That satisfied Amy, and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each. \u201cThe reward of merit for a magnanimous March,\u201d as Laurie announced with a flourish.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You\u2019ve behaved sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart,\u201d said Jo warmly, as they brushed their hair together late that night.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It must have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things. I don\u2019t believe I could have done it as kindly as you did,\u201d added Beth from her pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, girls, you needn\u2019t praise me so. I only did as I\u2019d be done by. You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know how. I can\u2019t explain exactly, but I want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. I\u2019m far from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother is.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, \u201cI understand now what you mean, and I\u2019ll never laugh at you again. You are getting on faster than you think, and I\u2019ll take lessons of you in true politeness, for you\u2019ve learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you\u2019ll get your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall.\u201d\r\n\r\nA week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be delighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March\u2019s face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth, who were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.\r\n\r\n\u201cAunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMe to go with her!\u201d burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, dear, not you. It\u2019s Amy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mother! She\u2019s too young, it\u2019s my turn first. I\u2019ve wanted it so long. It would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid. I must go!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn\u2019t fair, oh, it isn\u2019t fair!\u201d cried Jo passionately.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said\u2014\u2018I planned at first to ask Jo, but as \u2018favors burden her\u2019, and she \u2018hates French\u2019, I think I won\u2019t venture to invite her. Amy is more docile, will make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! Why can\u2019t I learn to keep it quiet?\u201d groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing. When she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said sorrowfully...\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so try to bear it cheerfully, and don\u2019t sadden Amy\u2019s pleasure by reproaches or regrets.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset. \u201cI\u2019ll take a leaf out of her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute of happiness. But it won\u2019t be easy, for it is a dreadful disappointment,\u201d and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo, dear, I\u2019m very selfish, but I couldn\u2019t spare you, and I\u2019m glad you are not going quite yet,\u201d whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it.\r\n\r\nBy the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without repinings at Amy\u2019s good fortune. The young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,\u201d she said impressively, as she scraped her best palette. \u201cIt will decide my career, for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose you haven\u2019t?\u201d said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,\u201d replied the aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You hate hard work, and you\u2019ll marry some rich man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,\u201d said Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don\u2019t believe that one will. I\u2019m sure I wish it would, for if I can\u2019t be an artist myself, I should like to be able to help those who are,\u201d said Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawing teacher.\r\n\r\n\u201cHum!\u201d said Jo, with a sigh. \u201cIf you wish it you\u2019ll have it, for your wishes are always granted\u2014mine never.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to go?\u201d asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife.\r\n\r\n\u201cRather!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, in a year or two I\u2019ll send for you, and we\u2019ll dig in the Forum for relics, and carry out all the plans we\u2019ve made so many times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes, if it ever does,\u201d returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.\r\n\r\nThere was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment till Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried till she couldn\u2019t cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed. Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last lingerer, saying with a sob...\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I\u2019ll come and comfort you,\u201d whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word.\r\n\r\nSo Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\r\nOUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT\r\n\r\nLondon\r\n\r\nDearest People, Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly. It\u2019s not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped here years ago, and won\u2019t go anywhere else. However, we don\u2019t mean to stay long, so it\u2019s no great matter. Oh, I can\u2019t begin to tell you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so I\u2019ll only give you bits out of my notebook, for I\u2019ve done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started.\r\n\r\nI sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Everyone was very kind to me, especially the officers. Don\u2019t laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have nothing to do, it\u2019s a mercy to make them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death, I\u2019m afraid.\r\n\r\nAunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself. Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves! It was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so grandly. I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her so much good. As for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or whatever the high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and tooted on the captain\u2019s speaking trumpet, she\u2019d have been in such a state of rapture.\r\n\r\nIt was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen\u2019s countryseats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning, but I didn\u2019t regret getting up to see it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it.\r\n\r\nAt Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed, and sung, with a look at me...\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, have you e\u2019er heard of Kate Kearney?\r\nShe lives on the banks of Killarney;\r\nFrom the glance of her eye,\r\nShun danger and fly,\r\nFor fatal\u2019s the glance of Kate Kearney.\u201d\r\n\r\nWasn\u2019t that nonsensical?\r\n\r\nWe only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It\u2019s a dirty, noisy place, and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved \u00e0 la mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said, with a grin, \u201cThere yer har, sir. I\u2019ve given \u2019em the latest Yankee shine.\u201d It amused Uncle immensely. Oh, I must tell you what that absurd Lennox did! He got his friend Ward, who came on with us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was a lovely one, with \u201cRobert Lennox\u2019s compliments,\u201d on the card. Wasn\u2019t that fun, girls? I like traveling.\r\n\r\nI never shall get to London if I don\u2019t hurry. The trip was like riding through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got nervous like Yankee biddies. Such perfect color I never saw, the grass so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a rapture all the way. So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn\u2019t be astonished at anything. This is the way we went on. Amy, flying up\u2014\u201cOh, that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!\u201d Flo, darting to my window\u2014\u201cHow sweet! We must go there sometime, won\u2019t we Papa?\u201d Uncle, calmly admiring his boots\u2014\u201cNo, my dear, not unless you want beer, that\u2019s a brewery.\u201d\r\n\r\nA pause\u2014then Flo cried out, \u201cBless me, there\u2019s a gallows and a man going up.\u201d \u201cWhere, where?\u201d shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains. \u201cA colliery,\u201d remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. \u201cHere\u2019s a lovely flock of lambs all lying down,\u201d says Amy. \u201cSee, Papa, aren\u2019t they pretty?\u201d added Flo sentimentally. \u201cGeese, young ladies,\u201d returns Uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the Flirtations of Captain Cavendish, and I have the scenery all to myself.\r\n\r\nOf course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn\u2019t half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is perfectly splendid. Things seem so cheap, nice ribbons only sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in Paris. Doesn\u2019t that sound sort of elegant and rich?\r\n\r\nFlo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that it wasn\u2019t the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone. It was so droll! For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up outside behind somewhere, and I couldn\u2019t get at him. He didn\u2019t hear me call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, mum?\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with an \u201cAye, aye, mum,\u201d the man made his horse walk, as if going to a funeral. I poked again and said, \u201cA little faster,\u201d then off he went, helter-skelter as before, and we resigned ourselves to our fate.\r\n\r\nToday was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more aristocratic than we look. The Duke of Devonshire lives near. I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate, and the Duke of Wellington\u2019s house is not far off. Such sights as I saw, my dear! It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch them.\r\n\r\nRotten Row means \u2018Route de Roi\u2019, or the king\u2019s way, but now it\u2019s more like a riding school than anything else. The horses are splendid, and the men, especially the grooms, ride well, but the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn\u2019t according to our rules. I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah\u2019s Ark. Everyone rides\u2014old men, stout ladies, little children\u2014and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair exchange rose buds, for it\u2019s the thing to wear one in the button-hole, and I thought it rather a nice little idea.\r\n\r\nIn the P.M. to Westminster Abbey, but don\u2019t expect me to describe it, that\u2019s impossible, so I\u2019ll only say it was sublime! This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s very late, but I can\u2019t let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening. Who do you think came in, as we were at tea? Laurie\u2019s English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughn! I was so surprised, for I shouldn\u2019t have known them but for the cards. Both are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, and uses no crutches. They had heard from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their house, but Uncle won\u2019t go, so we shall return the call, and see them as we can. They went to the theater with us, and we did have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other all our days. Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of her ill health. Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his \u2018respectful compliments to the big hat\u2019. Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there. What ages ago it seems, doesn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nAunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must stop. I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of parks, theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures who say \u201cAh!\u201d and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English lordliness. I long to see you all, and in spite of my nonsense am, as ever, your loving...\r\n\r\nAMY\r\n\r\nPARIS\r\n\r\nDear girls,\r\n\r\nIn my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they made for us. I enjoyed the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else, for at Hampton I saw Raphael\u2019s cartoons, and at the Museum, rooms full of pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great creatures. The day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I could copy, also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up. We \u2018did\u2019 London to our heart\u2019s content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry to go away, for though English people are slow to take you in, when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality, I think. The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter, and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don\u2019t, for Grace and I are great friends, and the boys very nice fellows, especially Fred.\r\n\r\nWell, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again, saying he had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland. Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn\u2019t say a word. And now we get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don\u2019t know what we should do without him. Uncle doesn\u2019t know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if it would make people understand him. Aunt\u2019s pronunciation is old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal, find we don\u2019t, and are very grateful to have Fred do the \u2018parley vooing\u2019, as Uncle calls it.\r\n\r\nSuch delightful times as we are having! Sight-seeing from morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes, and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures. Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no soul for art, but I have, and I\u2019m cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can. She would like the relics of great people better, for I\u2019ve seen her Napoleon\u2019s cocked hat and gray coat, his baby\u2019s cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie Antoinette\u2019s little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne\u2019s sword, and many other interesting things. I\u2019ll talk for hours about them when I come, but haven\u2019t time to write.\r\n\r\nThe Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full of bijouterie and lovely things that I\u2019m nearly distracted because I can\u2019t buy them. Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn\u2019t allow it. Then the Bois and Champs Elysees are tres magnifique. I\u2019ve seen the imperial family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought\u2014purple dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind.\r\n\r\nWe often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Pere la Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in, one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament. That is so Frenchy.\r\n\r\nOur rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the balcony, we look up and down the long, brilliant street. It is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our day\u2019s work to go out. Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever knew\u2014except Laurie, whose manners are more charming. I wish Fred was dark, for I don\u2019t fancy light men, however, the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won\u2019t find fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.\r\n\r\nNext week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as we shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty letters. I keep my diary, and try to \u2018remember correctly and describe clearly all that I see and admire\u2019, as Father advised. It is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.\r\n\r\nAdieu, I embrace you tenderly. \u201cVotre Amie.\u201d\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG\r\n\r\nMy dear Mamma,\r\n\r\nHaving a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I\u2019ll try to tell you what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you will see.\r\n\r\nThe sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it with all my might. Get Father\u2019s old guidebooks and read about it. I haven\u2019t words beautiful enough to describe it. At Coblentz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about one o\u2019clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and the students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing I ever saw\u2014the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.\r\n\r\nWhen they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and said I didn\u2019t throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to look like it.\r\n\r\nThe baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred lost some money, and I scolded him. He needs someone to look after him when Frank is not with him. Kate said once she hoped he\u2019d marry soon, and I quite agree with her that it would be well for him. Frankfurt was delightful. I saw Goethe\u2019s house, Schiller\u2019s statue, and Dannecker\u2019s famous \u2018Ariadne.\u2019 It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the story better. I didn\u2019t like to ask, as everyone knew it or pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all about it. I ought to have read more, for I find I don\u2019t know anything, and it mortifies me.\r\n\r\nNow comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred has just gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him. I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night. Since then I\u2019ve begun to feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven\u2019t flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and have done my very best. I can\u2019t help it if people like me. I don\u2019t try to make them, and it worries me if I don\u2019t care for them, though Jo says I haven\u2019t got any heart. Now I know Mother will shake her head, and the girls say, \u201cOh, the mercenary little wretch!\u201d, but I\u2019ve made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him, though I\u2019m not madly in love. I like him, and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich\u2014ever so much richer than the Laurences. I don\u2019t think his family would object, and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is! A city house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe in. I like it, for it\u2019s genuine. I\u2019ve seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should ask! And I\u2019d rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I hate poverty, and don\u2019t mean to bear it a minute longer than I can help. One of us must marry well. Meg didn\u2019t, Jo won\u2019t, Beth can\u2019t yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round. I wouldn\u2019t marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of that, and though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I\u2019ve been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little things showed it. He never goes with Flo, always gets on my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me. Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about \u2018ein wonderschones Blondchen\u2019, Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate. He isn\u2019t one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.\r\n\r\nWell, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the Post Restante for letters. We had a charming time poking about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his English wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion\u2019s head on the wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I\u2019d got into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl. I had a feeling that something was going to happen and I was ready for it. I didn\u2019t feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little excited.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by I heard Fred\u2019s voice, and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled that I forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said he\u2019d just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was very ill. So he was going at once on the night train and only had time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute because he said, as he shook hands, and said it in a way that I could not mistake, \u201cI shall soon come back, you won\u2019t forget me, Amy?\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while, for he is a rash boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet in Rome, and then, if I don\u2019t change my mind, I\u2019ll say \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d when he says \u201cWill you, please?\u201d\r\n\r\nOf course this is all very private, but I wished you to know what was going on. Don\u2019t be anxious about me, remember I am your \u2018prudent Amy\u2019, and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much advice as you like. I\u2019ll use it if I can. I wish I could see you for a good talk, Marmee. Love and trust me.\r\n\r\nEver your AMY\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\r\nTENDER TROUBLES\r\n\r\n\u201cJo, I\u2019m anxious about Beth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies came.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not her health that troubles me now, it\u2019s her spirits. I\u2019m sure there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think so, Mother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe sits alone a good deal, and doesn\u2019t talk to her father as much as she used. I found her crying over the babies the other day. When she sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in her face that I don\u2019t understand. This isn\u2019t like Beth, and it worries me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you asked her about it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that I stopped. I never force my children\u2019s confidence, and I seldom have to wait for long.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth\u2019s, and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, \u201cI think she is growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why or being able to explain them. Why, Mother, Beth\u2019s eighteen, but we don\u2019t realize it, and treat her like a child, forgetting she\u2019s a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo she is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,\u201d returned her mother with a sigh and a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one. I promise never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great comfort, Jo. I always feel strong when you are at home, now Meg is gone. Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon, but when the tug comes, you are always ready.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you know I don\u2019t mind hard jobs much, and there must always be one scrub in a family. Amy is splendid in fine works and I\u2019m not, but I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half the family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but if anything is amiss at home, I\u2019m your man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else. Be very kind, and don\u2019t let her think anyone watches or talks about her. If she only would get quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn\u2019t have a wish in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHappy woman! I\u2019ve got heaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear, what are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll settle Bethy\u2019s troubles, and then I\u2019ll tell you mine. They are not very wearing, so they\u2019ll keep.\u201d and Jo stitched away, with a wise nod which set her mother\u2019s heart at rest about her for the present at least.\r\n\r\nWhile apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her. A slight incident gave Jo the clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the rest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she and Beth were alone together. Yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth\u2019s work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal landscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, \u201cAll serene! Coming in tonight.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, \u201cHow strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum!\u201d said Jo, still intent upon her sister\u2019s face, for the bright color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge. Beth whisked it off, and in her half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill. Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about needing more paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!\u201d she said, sitting down in her own room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made. \u201cI never dreamed of such a thing. What will Mother say? I wonder if her...\u201d there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought. \u201cIf he shouldn\u2019t love back again, how dreadful it would be. He must. I\u2019ll make him!\u201d and she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall. \u201cOh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance. Here\u2019s Meg married and a mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love. I\u2019m the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief.\u201d Jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face opposite, \u201cNo thank you, sir, you\u2019re very charming, but you\u2019ve no more stability than a weathercock. So you needn\u2019t write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way, for it won\u2019t do a bit of good, and I won\u2019t have it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which only confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle, but so was everybody\u2019s. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others. Indeed, a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that \u2018our boy\u2019 was getting fonder than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn\u2019t hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, \u201cI told you so.\u201d But Jo hated \u2018philandering\u2019, and wouldn\u2019t allow it, always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.\r\n\r\nWhen Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month, but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope, despair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly conferences. But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious, and gave out that he was going to \u2018dig\u2019, intending to graduate in a blaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were less manageable.\r\n\r\nThings were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done before. If she had not got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course of romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual Beth lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly \u2018spin\u2019, and he never disappointed her. But that evening Jo fancied that Beth\u2019s eyes rested on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match, though the phrases, \u2018caught off a tice\u2019, \u2018stumped off his ground\u2019, and \u2018the leg hit for three\u2019, were as intelligible to her as Sanskrit. She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it, that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie\u2019s manner, that he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth\u2019s feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho knows? Stranger things have happened,\u201d thought Jo, as she fussed about the room. \u201cShe will make quite an angel of him, and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love each other. I don\u2019t see how he can help it, and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should she go? And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she sat down to settle that point.\r\n\r\nNow, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa\u2014long, broad, well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back, rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young women. They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always been Jo\u2019s favorite lounging place. Among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end. This repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.\r\n\r\nLaurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner. If \u2018the sausage\u2019 as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might approach and repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat five minutes, before a massive form appeared beside her, and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction...\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, this is filling at the price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo slang,\u201d snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared in a most mysterious manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, Jo, don\u2019t be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBeth will pet you. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of thing, unless you\u2019ve suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? Do you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard, but Jo quenched \u2018her boy\u2019 by turning on him with a stern query, \u201cHow many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot one, upon my word. She\u2019s engaged. Now then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of it, that\u2019s one of your foolish extravagances, sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don\u2019t care two pins,\u201d continued Jo reprovingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won\u2019t let me send them \u2018flowers and things\u2019, so what can I do? My feelings need a \u2018vent\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMother doesn\u2019t approve of flirting even in fun, and you do flirt desperately, Teddy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d give anything if I could answer, \u2018So do you\u2019. As I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll merely say that I don\u2019t see any harm in that pleasant little game, if all parties understand that it\u2019s only play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it does look pleasant, but I can\u2019t learn how it\u2019s done. I\u2019ve tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else is doing, but I don\u2019t seem to get on\u201d, said Jo, forgetting to play mentor.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far. I suppose it\u2019s natural to some people to please without trying, and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you can\u2019t flirt. It\u2019s really refreshing to see a sensible, straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do go on at such a rate I\u2019m ashamed of them. They don\u2019t mean any harm, I\u2019m sure, but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward, they\u2019d mend their ways, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit. If you behaved properly, they would, but knowing you like their nonsense, they keep it up, and then you blame them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch you know about it, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Laurie in a superior tone. \u201cWe don\u2019t like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes. The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully, among gentleman. Bless your innocent soul! If you could be in my place for a month you\u2019d see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin...\r\n\r\n\u201cOut upon you, fie upon you,\r\nBold-faced jig!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between Laurie\u2019s chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples. Jo knew that \u2018young Laurence\u2019 was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls. Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said, dropping her voice, \u201cIf you must have a \u2018vent\u2019, Teddy, go and devote yourself to one of the \u2018pretty, modest girls\u2019 whom you do respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really advise it?\u201d and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do, but you\u2019d better wait till you are through college, on the whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime. You\u2019re not half good enough for\u2014well, whoever the modest girl may be.\u201d and Jo looked a little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I\u2019m not!\u201d acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently wound Jo\u2019s apron tassel round his finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy on us, this will never do,\u201d thought Jo, adding aloud, \u201cGo and sing to me. I\u2019m dying for some music, and always like yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stay here, thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t, there isn\u2019t room. Go and make yourself useful, since you are too big to be ornamental. I thought you hated to be tied to a woman\u2019s apron string?\u201d retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words of his own.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that depends on who wears the apron!\u201d and Laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going?\u201d demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.\r\n\r\nHe fled at once, and the minute it was well, \u201cUp with the bonnets of bonnie Dundee,\u201d she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.\r\n\r\nJo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth\u2019s bedside, with the anxious inquiry, \u201cWhat is it, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were asleep,\u201d sobbed Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it the old pain, my precious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a new one, but I can bear it,\u201d and Beth tried to check her tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t, there is no cure.\u201d There Beth\u2019s voice gave way, and clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly that Jo was frightened.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it? Shall I call Mother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t call her, don\u2019t tell her. I shall be better soon. Lie down here and \u2018poor\u2019 my head. I\u2019ll be quiet and go to sleep, indeed I will.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth\u2019s hot forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full and she longed to speak. But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she believed she knew the cause of Beth\u2019s new pain, she only said, in her tenderest tone, \u201cDoes anything trouble you, deary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Jo,\u201d after a long pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it comfort you to tell me what it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now, not yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I won\u2019t ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo are always glad to hear and help you, if they can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it. I\u2019ll tell you by-and-by.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the pain better now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to sleep, dear. I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long, and a loving word can medicine most ills.\r\n\r\nBut Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project for some days, she confided it to her mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou asked me the other day what my wishes were. I\u2019ll tell you one of them, Marmee,\u201d she began, as they sat along together. \u201cI want to go away somewhere this winter for a change.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Jo?\u201d and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested a double meaning.\r\n\r\nWith her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, \u201cI want something new. I feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than I am. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring up, so as I can be spared this winter, I\u2019d like to hop a little way and try my wings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere will you hop?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew. It\u2019s rather hard to find just the thing, but I think I should suit if I tried.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!\u201d and Mrs. March looked surprised, but not displeased.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your friend\u2014the kindest soul that ever lived\u2014and would make things pleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and no one knows me there. Don\u2019t care if they do. It\u2019s honest work, and I\u2019m not ashamed of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I. But your writing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things, get new ideas, and even if I haven\u2019t much time there, I shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I know the others?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in her cheeks. \u201cIt may be vain and wrong to say it, but\u2014I\u2019m afraid\u2014Laurie is getting too fond of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you?\u201d and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely proud of him, but as for anything more, it\u2019s out of the question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of that, Jo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, please?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, dear, I don\u2019t think you suited to one another. As friends you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over, but I fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong wills, to get on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance, as well as love.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the feeling I had, though I couldn\u2019t express it. I\u2019m glad you think he is only beginning to care for me. It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn\u2019t fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of his feeling for you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe color deepened in Jo\u2019s cheeks as she answered, with the look of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it is so, Mother. He hasn\u2019t said anything, but he looks a great deal. I think I had better go away before it comes to anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, \u201cHow Mrs. Moffat would wonder at your want of management, if she knew, and how she will rejoice that Annie may still hope.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the same in all\u2014the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so, and I am content with her success. You I leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it, for only then will you find that there is something sweeter. Amy is my chief care now, but her good sense will help her. For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she may be well. By the way, she seems brighter this last day or two. Have you spoken to her?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by. I said no more, for I think I know it,\u201d and Jo told her little story.\r\n\r\nMrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that for Laurie\u2019s sake Jo should go away for a time.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled, then I\u2019ll run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic. Beth must think I\u2019m going to please myself, as I am, for I can\u2019t talk about Laurie to her. But she can pet and comfort him after I\u2019m gone, and so cure him of this romantic notion. He\u2019s been through so many little trials of the sort, he\u2019s used to it, and will soon get over his lovelornity.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this \u2018little trial\u2019 would be harder than the others, and that Laurie would not get over his \u2018lovelornity\u2019 as easily as heretofore.\r\n\r\nThe plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon, for Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her. The teaching would render her independent, and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable. Jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit. When all was settled, with fear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her surprise he took it very quietly. He had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant, and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, \u201cSo I am, and I mean this one shall stay turned.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart, for Beth seemed more cheerful, and hoped she was doing the best for all.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne thing I leave in your especial care,\u201d she said, the night before she left.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean your papers?\u201d asked Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my boy. Be very good to him, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I will, but I can\u2019t fill your place, and he\u2019ll miss you sadly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your charge, to plague, pet, and keep in order.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, for your sake,\u201d promised Beth, wondering why Jo looked at her so queerly.\r\n\r\nWhen Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, \u201cIt won\u2019t do a bit of good, Jo. My eye is on you, so mind what you do, or I\u2019ll come and bring you home.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\r\nJO\u2019S JOURNAL\r\n\r\nNew York, November\r\n\r\nDear Marmee and Beth,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to write you a regular volume, for I\u2019ve got heaps to tell, though I\u2019m not a fine young lady traveling on the continent. When I lost sight of Father\u2019s dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less, hadn\u2019t diverted my mind, for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar.\r\n\r\nSoon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little sky parlor\u2014all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like. A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke\u2019s private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I\u2019ve no doubt I shall make a model governess.\r\n\r\nI am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the great table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful, though no one will believe it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear, make yourself at home,\u201d said Mrs. K. in her motherly way, \u201cI\u2019m on the drive from morning to night, as you may suppose with such a family, but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the children are safe with you. My rooms are always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There\u2019s the tea bell, I must run and change my cap.\u201d And off she bustled, leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.\r\n\r\nAs I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, \u201cIt goes better so. The little back is too young to haf such heaviness.\u201d\r\n\r\nWasn\u2019t it good of him? I like such things, for as Father says, trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that evening, she laughed, and said, \u201cThat must have been Professor Bhaer, he\u2019s always doing things of that sort.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. K. told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good, but poor as a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according to the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not a very romantic story, but it interested me, and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars. There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to peep at him, and then I\u2019ll tell you how he looks. He\u2019s almost forty, so it\u2019s no harm, Marmee.\r\n\r\nAfter tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I attacked the big workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, so goodnight, and more tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTuesday Eve\r\n\r\nHad a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children acted like Sancho, and at one time I really thought I should shake them all round. Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk, and I went to my needlework like little Mabel \u2018with a willing mind\u2019. I was thanking my stars that I\u2019d learned to make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and someone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation, and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was there, and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at him. A regular German\u2014rather stout, with brown hair tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one\u2019s ears good, after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes were rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn\u2019t a really handsome feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth, yet I liked him, for he had a fine head, his linen was very nice, and he looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like an old friend. Then he smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in a loud, brisk tone, \u201cHerein!\u201d\r\n\r\nI was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going on.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe wants me Bhaer,\u201d said the mite, slamming down her book and running to meet him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThou shalt haf thy Bhaer. Come, then, and take a goot hug from him, my Tina,\u201d said the Professor, catching her up with a laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow me mus tuddy my lessin,\u201d went on the funny little thing. So he put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing her little fat finger down the page, as if finding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own, though she looked more French than German.\r\n\r\nAnother knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work, and there I virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door. One of the girls kept laughing affectedly, and saying, \u201cNow Professor,\u201d in a coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.\r\n\r\nBoth seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once I heard him say emphatically, \u201cNo, no, it is not so, you haf not attend to what I say,\u201d and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing exclamation, \u201cPrut! It all goes bad this day.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took just one more peep to see if he survived it. He seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and taking little Tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away. I fancy he has a hard life of it. Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn\u2019t go down to the five o\u2019clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would, just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me. So I made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as she is short and I\u2019m tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a failure. She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage and looked about me. The long table was full, and every one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially, who seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the word, vanishing as soon as they were done. There was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young couples absorbed in each other, married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in politics. I don\u2019t think I shall care to have much to do with any of them, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, who looks as if she had something in her.\r\n\r\nCast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other. If Amy had been here, she\u2019d have turned her back on him forever because, sad to relate, he had a great appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified \u2018her ladyship\u2019. I didn\u2019t mind, for I like \u2018to see folks eat with a relish\u2019, as Hannah says, and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.\r\n\r\nAs I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard one say low to the other, \u201cWho\u2019s the new party?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGoverness, or something of that sort.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the deuce is she at our table for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend of the old lady\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHandsome head, but no style.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it. Give us a light and come on.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt angry at first, and then I didn\u2019t care, for a governess is as good as a clerk, and I\u2019ve got sense, if I haven\u2019t style, which is more than some people have, judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys. I hate ordinary people!\r\n\r\nThursday\r\n\r\nYesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing in my little room, which is very cozy, with a light and fire. I picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor. It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. The little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is very fond of children, though a \u2018bacheldore\u2019. Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and the splendid tales he tells. The younger men quiz him, it seems, call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner of jokes on his name. But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says, and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways.\r\n\r\nThe maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, and kind. She spoke to me at dinner today (for I went to table again, it\u2019s such fun to watch people), and asked me to come and see her at her room. She has fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and seems friendly, so I shall make myself agreeable, for I do want to get into good society, only it isn\u2019t the same sort that Amy likes.\r\n\r\nI was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in with some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn\u2019t there, but Minnie, who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily. \u201cThis is Mamma\u2019s friend, Miss March.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and she\u2019s jolly and we like her lots,\u201d added Kitty, who is an \u2018enfant terrible\u2019.\r\n\r\nWe both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch. If so again, call at me and I come,\u201d he said, with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches.\r\n\r\nI promised I would, and he departed, but it seems as if I was doomed to see a good deal of him, for today as I passed his door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella. It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other. He didn\u2019t seem at all ashamed of it, for when I explained and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all, saying in his loud, cheerful way...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou haf a fine day to make your walk. Bon voyage, Mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. The German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty.\r\n\r\nSaturday\r\n\r\nNothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss Norton, who has a room full of pretty things, and who was very charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked me if I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts, as her escort, if I enjoyed them. She put it as a favor, but I\u2019m sure Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of kindness to me. I\u2019m as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from such people don\u2019t burden me, and I accepted gratefully.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are playing nargerie,\u201d explained Kitty.\r\n\r\n\u201cDis is mine effalunt!\u201d added Tina, holding on by the Professor\u2019s hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cMamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon, when Franz and Emil come, doesn\u2019t she, Mr. Bhaer?\u201d said Minnie.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018effalunt\u2019 sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of them, and said soberly to me, \u201cI gif you my wort it is so, if we make too large a noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we go more softly.\u201d\r\n\r\nI promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did, for a more glorious frolic I never witnessed. They played tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops, and the little \u2018koblods\u2019, who ride the snowflakes as they fall. I wish Americans were as simple and natural as Germans, don\u2019t you?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if motives of economy didn\u2019t stop me, for though I\u2019ve used thin paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need. Pray forward Amy\u2019s as soon as you can spare them. My small news will sound very flat after her splendors, but you will like them, I know. Is Teddy studying so hard that he can\u2019t find time to write to his friends? Take good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the babies, and give heaps of love to everyone. From your faithful Jo.\r\n\r\nP.S. On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather Bhaery, but I am always interested in odd people, and I really had nothing else to write about. Bless you!\r\n\r\nDECEMBER\r\n\r\nMy Precious Betsey,\r\n\r\nAs this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on, for though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful! After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by them, and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little lads, quite after my own heart, for the mixture of German and American spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in the house or out, for on pleasant days they all go to walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep order, and then such fun!\r\n\r\nWe are very good friends now, and I\u2019ve begun to take lessons. I really couldn\u2019t help it, and it all came about in such a droll way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke called to me one day as I passed Mr. Bhaer\u2019s room where she was rummaging.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come and help me put these books to rights, for I\u2019ve turned everything upside down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was \u2018a den\u2019 to be sure. Books and papers everywhere, a broken meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other. Half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts. Dirty little boots stood drying before the fire, and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found, one over the bird cage, one covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having been used as a holder.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch a man!\u201d laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the relics in the rag bag. \u201cI suppose the others are torn up to rig ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite tails. It\u2019s dreadful, but I can\u2019t scold him. He\u2019s so absent-minded and goodnatured, he lets those boys ride over him roughshod. I agreed to do his washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me mend them,\u201d said I. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it, and he needn\u2019t know. I\u2019d like to, he\u2019s so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two pairs of the socks, for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn\u2019t find it out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina runs in and out, leaving the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray him.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo!\u201d he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, \u201cyou peep at me, I peep at you, and this is not bad, but see, I am not pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,\u201d I blundered out, as red as a peony.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrut! We will make the time, and we fail not to find the sense. At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness, for look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay.\u201d And he pointed to my work \u2018Yes,\u2019 they say to one another, these so kind ladies, \u2018he is a stupid old fellow, he will see not what we do, he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.\u2019 \u201cAh! But I haf an eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this. Come, a little lesson then and now, or\u2014no more good fairy works for me and mine.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf course I couldn\u2019t say anything after that, and as it really is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began. I took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog. The Professor was very patient with me, but it must have been torment to him, and now and then he\u2019d look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up with me whether to laugh or cry. I tried both ways, and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room. I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever, but didn\u2019t blame him a particle, and was scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if I\u2019d covered myself in glory.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant little marchen together, and dig no more in that dry book, that goes in the corner for making us trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Anderson\u2019s fairy tales so invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely. I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away (no other word will express it) with all my might, tumbling over long words, pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute, and doing my very best. When I finished reading my first page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way, \u201cDas ist gut! Now we go well! My turn. I do him in German, gif me your ear.\u201d And away he went, rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear. Fortunately the story was The Constant Tin Soldier, which is droll, you know, so I could laugh, and I did, though I didn\u2019t understand half he read, for I couldn\u2019t help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so comical.\r\n\r\nAfter that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty well, for this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly. I like it very much, and he doesn\u2019t seem tired of it yet, which is very good of him, isn\u2019t it? I mean to give him something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money. Tell me something nice, Marmee.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow. You see Beth manages him better than I did. I\u2019m not jealous, dear, do your best, only don\u2019t make a saint of him. I\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t like him without a spice of human naughtiness. Read him bits of my letters. I haven\u2019t time to write much, and that will do just as well. Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.\r\n\r\nJANUARY\r\n\r\nA Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can\u2019t tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn\u2019t get it till night and had given up hoping. Your letter came in the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was disappointed, for I\u2019d had a \u2018kind of feeling\u2019 that you wouldn\u2019t forget me. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea, and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged it and pranced. It was so homey and refreshing that I sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in my usual absurd way. The things were just what I wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought. Beth\u2019s new \u2018ink bib\u2019 was capital, and Hannah\u2019s box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure. I\u2019ll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books Father has marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of books reminds me that I\u2019m getting rich in that line, for on New Year\u2019s Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare. It is one he values much, and I\u2019ve often admired it, set up in the place of honor with his German Bible, Plato, Homer, and Milton, so you may imagine how I felt when he brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my own name in it, \u201cfrom my friend Friedrich Bhaer\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou say often you wish a library. Here I gif you one, for between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one. Read him well, and he will help you much, for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen.\u201d\r\n\r\nI thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about \u2018my library\u2019, as if I had a hundred books. I never knew how much there was in Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me. Now don\u2019t laugh at his horrid name. It isn\u2019t pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people will say it, but something between the two, as only Germans can give it. I\u2019m glad you both like what I tell you about him, and hope you will know him some day. Mother would admire his warm heart, Father his wise head. I admire both, and feel rich in my new \u2018friend Friedrich Bhaer\u2019.\r\n\r\nNot having much money, or knowing what he\u2019d like, I got several little things, and put them about the room, where he would find them unexpectedly. They were useful, pretty, or funny, a new standish on his table, a little vase for his flower, he always has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says, and a holder for his blower, so that he needn\u2019t burn up what Amy calls \u2018mouchoirs\u2019. I made it like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body, and black and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy immensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue, so it was rather a failure after all. Poor as he is, he didn\u2019t forget a servant or a child in the house, and not a soul here, from the French laundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him. I was so glad of that.\r\n\r\nThey got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year\u2019s Eve. I didn\u2019t mean to go down, having no dress. But at the last minute, Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me lace and feathers. So I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask on. No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and no one dreamed of the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and cool, most of them, and so I am to whippersnappers) could dance and dress, and burst out into a \u2018nice derangement of epitaphs, like an allegory on the banks of the Nile\u2019. I enjoyed it very much, and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me. I heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I\u2019d been an actress, in fact, he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters. Meg will relish that joke. Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a perfect little fairy in his arms. To see them dance was \u2018quite a landscape\u2019, to use a Teddyism.\r\n\r\nI had a very happy New Year, after all, and when I thought it over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many failures, for I\u2019m cheerful all the time now, work with a will, and take more interest in other people than I used to, which is satisfactory. Bless you all! Ever your loving... Jo\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\r\nFRIEND\r\n\r\nThough very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort, Jo still found time for literary labors. The purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain her end were not the best. She saw that money conferred power, money and power, therefore, she resolved to have, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved more than life. The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth everything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years Jo\u2019s most cherished castle in the air.\r\n\r\nThe prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful chateau en Espagne. But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the giant\u2019s treasures, if I remember rightly. But the \u2018up again and take another\u2019 spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty, but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags.\r\n\r\nShe took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even all-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but concocted a \u2018thrilling tale\u2019, and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor of the Weekly Volcano. She had never read Sartor Resartus, but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by this reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much embarrassment...\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I wished to see Mr. Dashwood.\u201d\r\n\r\nDown went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman, and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep. Feeling that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence, blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion.\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend of mine desired me to offer\u2014a story\u2014just as an experiment\u2014would like your opinion\u2014be glad to write more if this suits.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript, and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers, and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a first attempt, I take it?\u201d observing that the pages were numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon\u2014sure sign of a novice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. She has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in the Blarneystone Banner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, did she?\u201d and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to take note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots. \u201cWell, you can leave it, if you like. We\u2019ve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present, but I\u2019ll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, Jo did not like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn\u2019t suit her at all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of \u2018my friend\u2019 was considered a good joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as he closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week.\r\n\r\nWhen she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced. Mr. Dashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable, and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners, so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take this (editors never say I), if you don\u2019t object to a few alterations. It\u2019s too long, but omitting the passages I\u2019ve marked will make it just the right length,\u201d he said, in a businesslike tone.\r\n\r\nJo hardly knew her own MS. again, so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might on being asked to cut off her baby\u2019s legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle, she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral reflections\u2014which she had carefully put in as ballast for much romance\u2014had been stricken out.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I took care to have a few of my sinners repent.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Dashwoods\u2019s editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had forgotten her \u2018friend\u2019, and spoken as only an author could.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals don\u2019t sell nowadays.\u201d Which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think it would do with these alterations, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a new plot, and pretty well worked up\u2014language good, and so on,\u201d was Mr. Dashwood\u2019s affable reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you\u2014that is, what compensation\u2014\u201d began Jo, not exactly knowing how to express herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this sort. Pay when it comes out,\u201d returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point had escaped him. Such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, you can have it,\u201d said Jo, handing back the story with a satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five seemed good pay.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this?\u201d asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and emboldened by her success.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll look at it. Can\u2019t promise to take it. Tell her to make it short and spicy, and never mind the moral. What name would your friend like to put on it?\u201d in a careless tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all, if you please, she doesn\u2019t wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume,\u201d said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as she likes, of course. The tale will be out next week. Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?\u201d asked Mr. Dashwood, who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll call. Good morning, Sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful remark, \u201cPoor and proud, as usual, but she\u2019ll do.\u201d\r\n\r\nFollowing Mr. Dashwood\u2019s directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend, she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.\r\n\r\nLike most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected. Her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely left him in the lurch.\r\n\r\nShe soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at home. She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon afterward. It was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories. Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.\r\n\r\nShe thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers, history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose. Jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents, incidents, and crimes. She excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons. She studied faces in the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her. She delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin, and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman\u2019s character. She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.\r\n\r\nShe was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of other people\u2019s passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest, brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who interested her in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and lovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a writer. Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and studied him\u2014a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.\r\n\r\nWhy everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first. He was neither rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth. He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake. Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. If he had any sorrow, \u2018it sat with its head under its wing\u2019, and he turned only his sunny side to the world. There were lines upon his forehead, but Time seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to others. The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and his big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than words.\r\n\r\nHis very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him comfortable. His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath. His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full. His very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy like other people\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward one\u2019s fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.\r\n\r\nJo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself, and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came to see him. He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss Norton divulged the pleasing fact. From her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She felt proud to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it. Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner. Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her. The solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor. She took them with her one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several celebrities.\r\n\r\nJo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. But her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all. Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on \u2018spirit, fire, and dew\u2019, to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance. Turning as from a fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with one of the Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party.\r\n\r\nBefore the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned, that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess. The conversations were miles beyond Jo\u2019s comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms, and the only thing \u2018evolved from her inner consciousness\u2019 was a bad headache after it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and, according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before, that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be the only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.\r\n\r\nShe looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear. He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions, not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young people, attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.\r\n\r\nHe bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of truth\u2014an eloquence which made his broken English musical and his plain face beautiful. He had a hard fight, for the wise men argued well, but he didn\u2019t know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he talked, the world got right again to Jo. The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed better than the new. God was not a blind force, and immortality was not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.\r\n\r\nShe did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent. She began to see that character is a better possession than money, rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be, \u2018truth, reverence, and good will\u2019, then her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.\r\n\r\nThis belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she coveted his respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything. It all grew out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s evident he doesn\u2019t look in his glass before coming down,\u201d thought Jo, with a smile, as he said \u201cGoot efening,\u201d and sat soberly down, quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear, for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big, hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. After the reading came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment. The Professor didn\u2019t know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible. . .\r\n\r\n\u201cMees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master\u2019s face? Haf you no respect for me, that you go on so bad?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat off?\u201d said Jo.\r\n\r\nLifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my cap. Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not well, you too shall wear him.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great disgust, \u201cI wish these papers did not come in the house. They are not for children to see, nor young people to read. It is not well, and I haf no patience with those who make this harm.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like it, but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano. It was not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no name to betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it troubled him. He did not say to himself, \u201cIt is none of my business. I\u2019ve no right to say anything,\u201d as many people would have done. He only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother\u2019s love and father\u2019s care, and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by the time the paper was turned, and Jo\u2019s needle threaded, he was ready to say quite naturally, but very gravely...\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you are right to put it from you. I do not think that good young girls should see such things. They are made pleasant to some, but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for it, I don\u2019t see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,\u201d said Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to sell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would not feel that the living was honest. They haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it. No, they should think a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in his hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like much to send all the rest after him,\u201d muttered the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.\r\n\r\nJo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute. Then she thought consolingly to herself, \u201cMine are not like that, they are only silly, never bad, so I won\u2019t be worried,\u201d and taking up her book, she said, with a studious face, \u201cShall we go on, Sir? I\u2019ll be very good and proper now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall hope so,\u201d was all he said, but he meant more than she imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully reread every one of her stories. Being a little shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book. Now she seemed to have on the Professor\u2019s mental or moral spectacles also, for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for each is more sensational than the last. I\u2019ve gone blindly on, hurting myself and other people, for the sake of money. I know it\u2019s so, for I can\u2019t read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it, and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I\u2019d better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder,\u201d she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.\r\n\r\nBut when nothing remained of all her three month\u2019s work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I haven\u2019t done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my time,\u201d she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, \u201cI almost wish I hadn\u2019t any conscience, it\u2019s so inconvenient. If I didn\u2019t care about doing right, and didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I should get on capitally. I can\u2019t help wishing sometimes, that Mother and Father hadn\u2019t been so particular about such things.\u201d\r\n\r\nAh, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that \u2018Father and Mother were particular\u2019, and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood.\r\n\r\nJo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs. Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral was it. She had her doubts about it from the beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century. She sent this didactic gem to several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn\u2019t sell.\r\n\r\nThen she tried a child\u2019s story, which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it. The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief. But much as she liked to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues. So nothing came of these trials, and Jo corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019ll wait until I do before I try again, and meantime, \u2018sweep mud in the street\u2019 if I can\u2019t do better, that\u2019s honest, at least.\u201d Which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good.\r\n\r\nWhile these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. He did it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she had given up writing. Not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.\r\n\r\nHe helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs. Kirke till June. Everyone seemed sorry when the time came. The children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer\u2019s hair stuck straight up all over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,\u201d he said, when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner, while she held a little levee on that last evening.\r\n\r\nShe was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and when his turn came, she said warmly, \u201cNow, Sir, you won\u2019t forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I\u2019ll never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to know my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you? Shall I come?\u201d he asked, looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, come next month. Laurie graduates then, and you\u2019d enjoy commencement as something new.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is your best friend, of whom you speak?\u201d he said in an altered tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my boy Teddy. I\u2019m very proud of him and should like you to see him.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr. Bhaer\u2019s face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a \u2018best friend\u2019, and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush, and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina on her knee. She didn\u2019t know what would have become of her. Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression, as he said cordially...\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much success, and you all happiness. Gott bless you!\u201d And with that, he shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.\r\n\r\nBut after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the \u2018heimweh\u2019, or homesickness, lying heavy at his heart. Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search of something that he could not find.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not for me, I must not hope it now,\u201d he said to himself, with a sigh that was almost a groan. Then, as if reproaching himself for the longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened his Plato.\r\n\r\nHe did his best and did it manfully, but I don\u2019t think he found that a pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.\r\n\r\nEarly as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off, and thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her company, and best of all, the happy thought, \u201cWell, the winter\u2019s gone, and I\u2019ve written no books, earned no fortune, but I\u2019ve made a friend worth having and I\u2019ll try to keep him all my life.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\r\nHEARTACHE\r\n\r\nWhatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his friends said. They were all there, his grandfather\u2014oh, so proud\u2014Mr. and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early tomorrow. You\u2019ll come and meet me as usual, girls?\u201d Laurie said, as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over. He said \u2018girls\u2019, but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up the old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful boy anything, and answered warmly...\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing \u2018Hail the conquering hero comes\u2019 on a jew\u2019s-harp.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic, \u201cOh, deary me! I know he\u2019ll say something, and then what shall I do?\u201d\r\n\r\nEvening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and having decided that she wouldn\u2019t be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy wouldn\u2019t do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings. A call at Meg\u2019s, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about and run away.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the jew\u2019s-harp, Jo?\u201d cried Laurie, as soon as he was within speaking distance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgot it.\u201d And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not be called lover-like.\r\n\r\nShe always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did not, and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove. Then he walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and now and then a dreadful pause occurred. To rescue the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said hastily, \u201cNow you must have a good long holiday!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI intend to.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, \u201cNo, Teddy. Please don\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, and you must hear me. It\u2019s no use, Jo, we\u2019ve got to have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us,\u201d he answered, getting flushed and excited all at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay what you like then. I\u2019ll listen,\u201d said Jo, with a desperate sort of patience.\r\n\r\nLaurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to \u2018have it out\u2019, if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get choky now and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady...\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve loved you ever since I\u2019ve known you, Jo, couldn\u2019t help it, you\u2019ve been so good to me. I\u2019ve tried to show it, but you wouldn\u2019t let me. Now I\u2019m going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I can\u2019t go on so any longer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to save you this. I thought you\u2019d understand...\u201d began Jo, finding it a great deal harder than she expected.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they mean. They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it,\u201d returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away to keep you from it if I could.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought so. It was like you, but it was no use. I only loved you all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards and everything you didn\u2019t like, and waited and never complained, for I hoped you\u2019d love me, though I\u2019m not half good enough...\u201d Here there was a choke that couldn\u2019t be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his \u2018confounded throat\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou, you are, you\u2019re a great deal too good for me, and I\u2019m so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t love you as you want me to. I\u2019ve tried, but I can\u2019t change the feeling, and it would be a lie to say I do when I don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, truly, Jo?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, truly, dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words fell reluctantly from Jo\u2019s lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life the fence was too much for him. So he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still that Jo was frightened.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Teddy, I\u2019m sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it would do any good! I wish you wouldn\u2019t take it so hard, I can\u2019t help it. You know it\u2019s impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they don\u2019t,\u201d cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey do sometimes,\u201d said a muffled voice from the post. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the right sort of love, and I\u2019d rather not try it,\u201d was the decided answer.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, \u201cLaurie, I want to tell you something.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in a fierce tone, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that, Jo, I can\u2019t bear it now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell what?\u201d she asked, wondering at his violence.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you love that old man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat old man?\u201d demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you love him, I know I shall do something desperate;\u201d and he looked as if he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes.\r\n\r\nJo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she too, was getting excited with all this, \u201cDon\u2019t swear, Teddy! He isn\u2019t old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I\u2019ve got, next to you. Pray, don\u2019t fly into a passion. I want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor. I haven\u2019t the least idea of loving him or anybody else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you will after a while, and then what will become of me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t love anyone else, and I\u2019ll never forget you, Jo, Never! Never!\u201d with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall I do with him?\u201d sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more unmanagable than she expected. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard what I wanted to tell you. Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make you happy,\u201d she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which proved that she knew nothing about love.\r\n\r\nSeeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo\u2019s part, for how could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him? She gently turned his head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake\u2014how touching that was, to be sure! \u201cI agree with Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we were so foolish as to...\u201d Jo paused a little over the last word, but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarry\u2014no we shouldn\u2019t! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect saint, for you could make me anything you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried and failed, and I won\u2019t risk our happiness by such a serious experiment. We don\u2019t agree and we never shall, so we\u2019ll be good friends all our lives, but we won\u2019t go and do anything rash.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we will if we get the chance,\u201d muttered Laurie rebelliously.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,\u201d implored Jo, almost at her wit\u2019s end.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be reasonable. I don\u2019t want to take what you call \u2018a sensible view\u2019. It won\u2019t help me, and it only makes it harder. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve got any heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a little quiver in Jo\u2019s voice, and thinking it a good omen, Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously wheedlesome before, \u201cDon\u2019t disappoint us, dear! Everyone expects it. Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people like it, and I can\u2019t get on without you. Say you will, and let\u2019s be happy. Do, do!\u201d\r\n\r\nNot until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard to do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say \u2018yes\u2019 truly, so I won\u2019t say it at all. You\u2019ll see that I\u2019m right, by-and-by, and thank me for it...\u201d she began solemnly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be hanged if I do!\u201d and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning with indignation at the very idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you will!\u201d persisted Jo. \u201cYou\u2019ll get over this after a while, and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house. I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m homely and awkward and odd and old, and you\u2019d be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel\u2014we can\u2019t help it even now, you see\u2014and I shouldn\u2019t like elegant society and you would, and you\u2019d hate my scribbling, and I couldn\u2019t get on without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn\u2019t done it, and everything would be horrid!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything more?\u201d asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing more, except that I don\u2019t believe I shall ever marry. I\u2019m happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know better!\u201d broke in Laurie. \u201cYou think so now, but there\u2019ll come a time when you will care for somebody, and you\u2019ll love him tremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will, it\u2019s your way, and I shall have to stand by and see it,\u201d and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical, if his face had not been so tragic.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!\u201d cried Jo, losing patience with poor Teddy. \u201cI\u2019ve done my best, but you won\u2019t be reasonable, and it\u2019s selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can\u2019t give. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but I\u2019ll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for both of us\u2014so now!\u201d\r\n\r\nThat speech was like gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away, saying in a desperate sort of tone, \u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry some day, Jo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, where are you going?\u201d she cried, for his face frightened her.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the devil!\u201d was the consoling answer.\r\n\r\nFor a minute Jo\u2019s heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure. He had no thought of a melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time up the river than he had done in any race. Jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do him good, and he\u2019ll come home in such a tender, penitent state of mind, that I shan\u2019t dare to see him,\u201d she said, adding, as she went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing, and buried it under the leaves. \u201cNow I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy. I wish he\u2019d love Beth, perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her. Oh dear! How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them? I think it\u2019s dreadful.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeing sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harm\u2019s way, for Young Impetuosity\u2019s parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.\r\n\r\nWhen Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of the last year\u2019s success, which to him now seemed like love\u2019s labor lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went to his piano and began to play. The windows were open, and Jo, walking in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her sister, for he played the \u2018Sonata Pathetique\u2019, and played it as he never did before.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very fine, I dare say, but it\u2019s sad enough to make one cry. Give us something gayer, lad,\u201d said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew not how.\r\n\r\nLaurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull Mrs. March\u2019s voice had not been heard calling, \u201cJo, dear, come in. I want you.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, and the musician sat silent in the dark.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand this,\u201d muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, \u201cI know, my boy, I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, \u201cWho told you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJo herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen there\u2019s an end of it!\u201d And he shook off his grandfather\u2019s hands with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his man\u2019s pride could not bear a man\u2019s pity.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot quite. I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of it,\u201d returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. \u201cYou won\u2019t care to stay at home now, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to run away from a girl. Jo can\u2019t prevent my seeing her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,\u201d interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot if you are the gentleman I think you. I\u2019m disappointed, but the girl can\u2019t help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time. Where will you go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnywhere. I don\u2019t care what becomes of me,\u201d and Laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather\u2019s ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake it like a man, and don\u2019t do anything rash, for God\u2019s sake. Why not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got through college.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but I didn\u2019t mean to go alone!\u201d and Laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t ask you to go alone. There\u2019s someone ready and glad to go with you, anywhere in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho, Sir?\u201d stopping to listen.\r\n\r\n\u201cMyself.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying huskily, \u201cI\u2019m a selfish brute, but\u2014you know\u2014Grandfather\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord help me, yes, I do know, for I\u2019ve been through it all before, once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy, just sit quietly down and hear my plan. It\u2019s all settled, and can be carried out at once,\u201d said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man, as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, what is it?\u201d and Laurie sat down, without a sign of interest in face or voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is business in London that needs looking after. I meant you should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do almost everything, I\u2019m merely holding on until you take my place, and can be off at any time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you hate traveling, Sir. I can\u2019t ask it of you at your age,\u201d began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go alone, if he went at all.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to prevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him, he said stoutly, \u201cBless your soul, I\u2019m not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea. It will do me good, and my old bones won\u2019t suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair.\u201d\r\n\r\nA restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I think you\u2019d feel happier than if I was left behind. I don\u2019t intend to gad about with you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my own way. I\u2019ve friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit them. Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness. He sighed, and then said, in a spiritless tone, \u201cJust as you like, Sir. It doesn\u2019t matter where I go or what I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does to me, remember that, my lad. I give you entire liberty, but I trust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me that, Laurie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything you like, Sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d thought the old gentleman. \u201cYou don\u2019t care now, but there\u2019ll come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I\u2019m much mistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeing an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel, they were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases. He was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite, neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this was a relief to his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the \u2018poor, dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble, and come home happy\u2019. Of course, he smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable.\r\n\r\nWhen the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves. This gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with a whisper full of motherly solicitude. Then feeling that he was going very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life. Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. He did look round, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jo, can\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTeddy, dear, I wish I could!\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was all, except a little pause. Then Laurie straightened himself up, said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, never mind,\u201d and went away without another word. Ah, but it wasn\u2019t all right, and Jo did mind, for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when he left her without a look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\r\nBETH\u2019S SECRET\r\n\r\nWhen Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo\u2019s heart as she saw her sister\u2019s face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo for a time forgot her fear.\r\n\r\nBut when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety returned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and been forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip, Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from home. Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another. Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care for anyone else. So they were all in all to each other, and came and went, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away.\r\n\r\nThey did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and Beth\u2019s, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there seemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to speak. She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo\u2019s lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.\r\n\r\nOne day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still, and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth\u2019s cheeks. But she could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting. It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say, \u201cJo, dear, I\u2019m glad you know it. I\u2019ve tried to tell you, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer except her sister\u2019s cheek against her own, not even tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She was the weaker then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve known it for a good while, dear, and now I\u2019m used to it, it isn\u2019t hard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so and don\u2019t be troubled about me, because it\u2019s best, indeed it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?\u201d asked Jo, refusing to see or say that it was best, but glad to know that Laurie had no part in Beth\u2019s trouble.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn\u2019t like to own it. I tried to think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble anyone. But when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it was hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable, Jo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Beth, and you didn\u2019t tell me, didn\u2019t let me comfort and help you? How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say goodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right. I wasn\u2019t sure, no one said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie\u2014at least I thought so then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I couldn\u2019t,\u201d cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.\r\n\r\nBeth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain, and added softly, \u201cThen you didn\u2019t, dearie? I was afraid it was so, and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?\u201d asked Beth, as innocently as a child. \u201cI do love him dearly. He is so good to me, how can I help It? But he could never be anything to me but my brother. I hope he truly will be, sometime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot through me,\u201d said Jo decidedly. \u201cAmy is left for him, and they would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things, now. I don\u2019t care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little, and feel more sure that I shall never gain it back. It\u2019s like the tide, Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too young, Beth. I can\u2019t let you go. I\u2019ll work and pray and fight against it. I\u2019ll keep you in spite of everything. There must be ways, it can\u2019t be too late. God won\u2019t be so cruel as to take you from me,\u201d cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously submissive than Beth\u2019s.\r\n\r\nSimple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety. It shows itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than homilies or protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death. Like a confiding child, she asked no questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say, \u201cI\u2019m glad to go,\u201d for life was very sweet for her. She could only sob out, \u201cI try to be willing,\u201d while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together.\r\n\r\nBy and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, \u201cYou\u2019ll tell them this when we go home?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think they will see it without words,\u201d sighed Jo, for now it seemed to her that Beth changed every day.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps not. I\u2019ve heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things. If they don\u2019t see it, you will tell them for me. I don\u2019t want any secrets, and it\u2019s kinder to prepare them. Meg has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by Father and Mother, won\u2019t you Jo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I can. But, Beth, I don\u2019t give up yet. I\u2019m going to believe that it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it\u2019s true.\u201d said Jo, trying to speak cheerfully.\r\n\r\nBeth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to express myself, and shouldn\u2019t try to anyone but you, because I can\u2019t speak out except to my Jo. I only mean to say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. I\u2019m not like the rest of you. I never made any plans about what I\u2019d do when I grew up. I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn\u2019t seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about at home, of no use anywhere but there. I never wanted to go away, and the hard part now is the leaving you all. I\u2019m not afraid, but it seems as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. A white-winged gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast. Beth watched it till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness. A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach \u2018peeping\u2019 softly to itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea. It came quite close to Beth, and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone, dressing its wet feathers, quite at home. Beth smiled and felt comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better than the gulls. They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy, confiding little things. I used to call them my birds last summer, and Mother said they reminded her of me\u2014busy, quaker-colored creatures, always near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song of theirs. You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone. Meg is the turtledove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again. Dear little girl! She\u2019s so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home. I hope I shall see her again, but she seems so far away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her. I\u2019m going to have you well and rosy by that time,\u201d began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo, dear, don\u2019t hope any more. It won\u2019t do any good. I\u2019m sure of that. We won\u2019t be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait. We\u2019ll have happy times, for I don\u2019t suffer much, and I think the tide will go out easily, if you help me.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent kiss, she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.\r\n\r\nShe was right. There was no need of any words when they got home, for Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing. Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed, saying how glad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth\u2019s secret. Her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in, but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo went to comfort her without a word.\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\r\nNEW IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\nAt three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais\u2014a charming place, for the wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills. Many nations are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival. Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing the latest celebrity who has arrived\u2014Ristori or Dickens, Victor Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands. The equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch behind.\r\n\r\nAlong this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance. He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the independent air of an American\u2014a combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the young man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at some blonde girl in blue. Presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the beach toward Castle Hill. The quick trot of ponies\u2019 feet made him look up, as one of the little carriages, containing a single young lady, came rapidly down the street. The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in blue. He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up, and, waving his hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Laurie, is it really you? I thought you\u2019d never come!\u201d cried Amy, dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the great scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter\u2019s steps, lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these \u2018mad English\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you, and here I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you staying?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well\u2014last night\u2014at the Chauvain. I called at your hotel, but you were out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have so much to say, I don\u2019t know where to begin! Get in and we can talk at our ease. I was going for a drive and longing for company. Flo\u2019s saving up for tonight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat happens then, a ball?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there, and they give it in honor of the day. You\u2019ll go with us, of course? Aunt will be charmed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. Where now?\u201d asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies\u2019 backs afforded her infinite satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill. The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever been there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOften, years ago, but I don\u2019t mind having a look at it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has settled for the winter. He has friends there and finds plenty to amuse him, so I go and come, and we get on capitally.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a sociable arrangement,\u201d said Amy, missing something in Laurie\u2019s manner, though she couldn\u2019t tell what.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each suit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he added, with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dirt is picturesque, so I don\u2019t mind. The river and the hills are delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my delight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass. It\u2019s going to the Church of St. John.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside her. He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired and spiritless\u2014not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him. She couldn\u2019t understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she shook her head and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.\r\n\r\n\u201cQue pensez-vous?\u201d she said, airing her French, which had improved in quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is charming,\u201d replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and an admiring look.\r\n\r\nShe blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was \u2018altogether jolly\u2019, with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head. She didn\u2019t like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded indifferent in spite of the look.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the way he\u2019s going to grow up, I wish he\u2019d stay a boy,\u201d she thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay.\r\n\r\nAt Avigdor\u2019s she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeth is very poorly, Mother says. I often think I ought to go home, but they all say \u2018stay\u2019. So I do, for I shall never have another chance like this,\u201d said Amy, looking sober over one page.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you are right, there. You could do nothing at home, and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and enjoying so much, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he said that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy\u2019s heart was lightened, for the look, the act, the brotherly \u2018my dear\u2019, seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land. Presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, \u2018Genius burns!\u2019.\r\n\r\nLaurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket \u2018to keep it from blowing away\u2019, and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,\u201d said Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed. While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him, with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought. He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance. Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was, but her old petulance now and then showed itself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign polish.\r\n\r\nLaurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks, but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene.\r\n\r\nAs they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing here and there, \u201cDo you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert\u2019s Tower, just below, and best of all, that speck far out to sea which they say is Corsica?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI remember. It\u2019s not much changed,\u201d he answered without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!\u201d said Amy, feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting in his sight.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while,\u201d said Amy, seating herself, ready for a good talk.\r\n\r\nBut she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the Continent and been to Greece. So after idling away an hour, they drove home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left them, promising to return in the evening.\r\n\r\nIt must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night. Time and absence had done its work on both the young people. She had seen her old friend in a new light, not as \u2018our boy\u2019, but as a handsome and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight. Amy knew her good points, and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman.\r\n\r\nTarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were both inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,\u201d said Amy to herself, as she put on Flo\u2019s old white silk ball dress, and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the fashion, but it\u2019s becoming, and I can\u2019t afford to make a fright of myself,\u201d she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or braid, as the latest style commanded.\r\n\r\nHaving no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted boots, she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and chasseed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the real lace on Aunt\u2019s mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,\u201d she said, surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away. She seldom ran\u2014it did not suit her style, she thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante. She walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the chandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress, the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a well-placed statue.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood evening, Diana!\u201d said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood evening, Apollo!\u201d she answered, smiling back at him, for he too looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere are your flowers. I arranged them myself, remembering that you didn\u2019t like what Hannah calls a \u2018sot-bookay\u2019,\u201d said Laurie, handing her a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in Cardiglia\u2019s window.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow kind you are!\u201d she exclaimed gratefully. \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were coming I\u2019d have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty as this, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. It isn\u2019t what it should be, but you have improved it,\u201d he added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you liked that sort of thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot from you, it doesn\u2019t sound natural, and I like your old bluntness better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of it,\u201d he answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home.\r\n\r\nThe company assembled in the long salle a manger, that evening, was such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their Christmas ball.\r\n\r\nA Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet\u2019s mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted himself to the ladies, who pronounced him, \u2018a fascinating dear\u2019, and a German Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely about, seeking what he might devour. Baron Rothschild\u2019s private secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the world, as if his master\u2019s name crowned him with a golden halo. A stout Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing, and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little family of eight. Of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto, and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters.\r\n\r\nAny young girl can imagine Amy\u2019s state of mind when she \u2018took the stage\u2019 that night, leaning on Laurie\u2019s arm. She knew she looked well, she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. She did pity the Davis girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it permitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking friend might be. With the first burst of the band, Amy\u2019s color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know it. Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, \u201cDo you care to dance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne usually does at a ball.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cI meant the first dance. May I have the honor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances divinely, but he will excuse me, as you are an old friend,\u201d said Amy, hoping that the name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be trifled with.\r\n\r\n\u201cNice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support...\r\n\r\nA daughter of the gods,\r\nDevinely tall, and most divinely fair,\u201d\r\n\r\nwas all the satisfaction she got, however.\r\n\r\nThe set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish. Laurie resigned her to the \u2018nice little boy\u2019, and went to do his duty to Flo, without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. She showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka redowa. But his polite regrets didn\u2019t impose upon her, and when she galloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief.\r\n\r\nThat was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moment\u2019s rest. Her anger had a good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie\u2019s eyes followed her with pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. He very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view, and before the evening was half over, had decided that \u2018little Amy was going to make a very charming woman\u2019.\r\n\r\nIt was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine, hearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, and banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who couldn\u2019t admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. The air was dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young giraffes. The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train. The serene Teuton found the supper-table and was happy, eating steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garcons by the ravages he committed. But the Emperor\u2019s friend covered himself with glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he \u2018carried weight\u2019, he danced like an India-rubber ball. He ran, he flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.\r\n\r\nAmy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished her, with assurances that he was \u2018desolated to leave so early\u2019, she was ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.\r\n\r\nIt had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. Laurie had a waked-up look as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to bring her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, \u201cAh, I thought that would do him good!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou look like Balzac\u2019s \u2018Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme\u2019,\u201d he said, as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy rouge won\u2019t come off.\u201d and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you call this stuff?\u201d he asked, touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee.\r\n\r\n\u201cIllusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood name for it. It\u2019s very pretty\u2014new thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as old as the hills. You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now\u2014stupide!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of that, it is forbidden. I\u2019d rather take coffee than compliments just now. No, don\u2019t lounge, it makes me nervous.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having \u2018little Amy\u2019 order him about, for she had lost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him, as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you learn all this sort of thing?\u201d he asked with a quizzical look.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs \u2018this sort of thing\u2019 is rather a vague expression, would you kindly explain?\u201d returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014the general air, the style, the self-possession, the\u2014the\u2014illusion\u2014you know\u201d, laughed Laurie, breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word.\r\n\r\nAmy was gratified, but of course didn\u2019t show it, and demurely answered, \u201cForeign life polishes one in spite of one\u2019s self. I study as well as play, and as for this\u201d\u2014with a little gesture toward her dress\u2014\u201cwhy, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used to making the most of my poor little things.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn\u2019t in good taste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers. Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner; but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\r\nON THE SHELF\r\n\r\nIn France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married, when \u2018Vive la liberte!\u2019 becomes their motto. In America, as everyone knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a very pretty woman the other day, \u201cI\u2019m as handsome as ever, but no one takes any notice of me because I\u2019m married.\u201d\r\n\r\nNot being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little world primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever.\r\n\r\nAs she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen department. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored. But three months passed, and there was no return of repose. Meg looked worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life \u2018aisy\u2019, kept him on short commons. When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he came gaily in at night, eager to embrace his family, he was quenched by a \u201cHush! They are just asleep after worrying all day.\u201d If he proposed a little amusement at home, \u201cNo, it would disturb the babies.\u201d If he hinted at a lecture or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a decided\u2014\u201cLeave my children for pleasure, never!\u201d His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night. His meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above. And when he read his paper of an evening, Demi\u2019s colic got into the shipping list and Daisy\u2019s fall affected the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.\r\n\r\nThe poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual \u2018hushing\u2019 made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, and when no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles do\u2014tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs. Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she performed her mission most successfully. The parlor was always bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty of gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.\r\n\r\nJohn would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his neighbor\u2019s society.\r\n\r\nMeg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children. But by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John, and find her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender. She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told, entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them. Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she would say, looking in the glass, \u201cI\u2019m getting old and ugly. John doesn\u2019t find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances. Well, the babies love me, they don\u2019t care if I am thin and pale and haven\u2019t time to crimp my hair, they are my comfort, and some day John will see what I\u2019ve gladly sacrificed for them, won\u2019t he, my precious?\u201d\r\n\r\nTo which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him. Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg\u2019s drooping spirits had not escaped her observation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do need advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well be widowed,\u201d replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy\u2019s bib with an injured air.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoes on how, my dear?\u201d asked her mother anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s away all day, and at night when I want to see him, he is continually going over to the Scotts\u2019. It isn\u2019t fair that I should have the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish, even the best of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo are women. Don\u2019t blame John till you see where you are wrong yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it can\u2019t be right for him to neglect me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you neglect him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mother, I thought you\u2019d take my part!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault is yours, Meg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only leisure time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I can\u2019t do it now, with two babies to tend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you could, dear, and I think you ought. May I speak quite freely, and will you remember that it\u2019s Mother who blames as well as Mother who sympathizes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg drew her low chair beside her mother\u2019s, and with a little interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have only made the mistake that most young wives make\u2014forgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways, for children should draw you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and John had nothing to do but support them. I\u2019ve seen it for some weeks, but have not spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t. If I ask him to stay, he\u2019ll think I\u2019m jealous, and I wouldn\u2019t insult him by such an idea. He doesn\u2019t see that I want him, and I don\u2019t know how to tell him without words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMake it so pleasant he won\u2019t want to go away. My dear, he\u2019s longing for his little home, but it isn\u2019t home without you, and you are always in the nursery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOughtn\u2019t I to be there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John as well as to the babies. Don\u2019t neglect husband for children, don\u2019t shut him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as well as yours, and the children need him. Let him feel that he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be better for you all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really think so, Mother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it, Meg, for I\u2019ve tried it, and I seldom give advice unless I\u2019ve proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on just as you are, feeling as if I didn\u2019t do my duty unless I devoted myself wholly to you. Poor Father took to his books, after I had refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me. I nearly spoiled her by indulgence. You were poorly, and I worried about you till I fell sick myself. Then Father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never have been able to get on without him since. That is the secret of our home happiness. He does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but at home we work together, always.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours. Show me how, I\u2019ll do anything you say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou always were my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were you, I\u2019d let John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs training, and it\u2019s none too soon to begin. Then I\u2019d do what I have often proposed, let Hannah come and help you. She is a capital nurse, and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework. You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and John would find his wife again. Go out more, keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair weather. Then I\u2019d try to take an interest in whatever John likes\u2014talk with him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in that way. Don\u2019t shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and educate yourself to take your part in the world\u2019s work, for it all affects you and yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn is so sensible, I\u2019m afraid he will think I\u2019m stupid if I ask questions about politics and things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe he would. Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him? Try it, and see if he doesn\u2019t find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott\u2019s suppers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will. Poor John! I\u2019m afraid I have neglected him sadly, but I thought I was right, and he never said anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, I fancy. This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together, for the first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it. And no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train. Don\u2019t let John be a stranger to the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should. Now, dear, good-by. Think over Mother\u2019s preachment, act upon it if it seems good, and God bless you all.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. Of course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted. Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a trifle of his sire\u2019s firmness of character, we won\u2019t call it obstinacy, and when he made up his little mind to have or to do anything, all the king\u2019s horses and all the king\u2019s men could not change that pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience. So Master Demi early discovered that when he undertook to \u2018wrastle\u2019 with \u2018Parpar\u2019, he always got the worst of it, yet like the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him, and loved the father whose grave \u201cNo, no,\u201d was more impressive than all Mamma\u2019s love pats.\r\n\r\nA few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social evening with John, so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early, that nothing should interfere with her experiment. But unfortunately Demi\u2019s most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he decided to go on a rampage. So poor Meg sang and rocked, told stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could devise, but all in vain, the big eyes wouldn\u2019t shut, and long after Daisy had gone to byelow, like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was, naughty Demi lay staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression of countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives poor Papa his tea?\u201d asked Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe has tea!\u201d said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you\u2019ll go bye-bye like Daisy. Will you, lovey?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIss!\u201d and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration. He saw it at once and said with pleased surprise, \u201cWhy, little mother, how gay we are tonight. Do you expect company?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly you, dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. You always make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are, so why shouldn\u2019t I when I have the time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do it out of respect for you, my dear,\u201d said old-fashioned John.\r\n\r\n\u201cDitto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,\u201d laughed Meg, looking young and pretty again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s altogether delightful, and like old times. This tastes right. I drink your health, dear.\u201d and John sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as he put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little voice was heard, saying impatiently...\r\n\r\n\u201cOpy doy. Me\u2019s tummin!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas,\u201d said Meg, answering the call.\r\n\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019 now,\u201d announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the \u2018cakies\u2019 with loving glances.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble poor Mamma. Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMe loves Parpar,\u201d said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook his head, and said to Meg...\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do it, or he will never learn to mind you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, of course. Come, Demi,\u201d and Meg led her son away, feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her, laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery.\r\n\r\nNor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more promenades till morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cIss!\u201d said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.\r\n\r\nMeg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding, \u201cMore sudar, Marmar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow this won\u2019t do,\u201d said John, hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner. \u201cWe shall never know any peace till that child learns to go to bed properly. You have made a slave of yourself long enough. Give him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it. Put him in his bed and leave him, Meg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe won\u2019t stay there, he never does unless I sit by him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll manage him. Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as Mamma bids you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cS\u2019ant!\u201d replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted \u2018cakie\u2019, and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must never say that to Papa. I shall carry you if you don\u2019t go yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo \u2019way, me don\u2019t love Parpar.\u201d and Demi retired to his mother\u2019s skirts for protection.\r\n\r\nBut even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to the enemy, with a \u201cBe gentle with him, John,\u201d which struck the culprit with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day was at hand. Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs. The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled out on the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again, which lively performance was kept up till the young man\u2019s strength gave out, when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice. This vocal exercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the \u2018big dark\u2019 which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear. This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for \u2018Marmar\u2019, as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg\u2019s heart, and she ran up to say beseechingly...\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me stay with him, he\u2019ll be good now, John.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my dear. I\u2019ve told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him, and he must, if I stay here all night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019ll cry himself sick,\u201d pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for deserting her boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he won\u2019t, he\u2019s so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled, for he will understand that he has got to mind. Don\u2019t interfere, I\u2019ll manage him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s my child, and I can\u2019t have his spirit broken by harshness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s my child, and I won\u2019t have his temper spoiled by indulgence. Go down, my dear, and leave the boy to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never regretted her docility.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease let me kiss him once, John?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and rest, for she is very tired with taking care of you all day.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor little man, he\u2019s worn out with sleep and crying. I\u2019ll cover him up, and then go and set Meg\u2019s heart at rest,\u201d thought John, creeping to the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.\r\n\r\nBut he wasn\u2019t, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi\u2019s eyes opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying with a penitent hiccough, \u201cMe\u2019s dood, now.\u201d\r\n\r\nSitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest. Demi lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father\u2019s arm and holding his father\u2019s finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby. So held, John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole day\u2019s work.\r\n\r\nAs Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, \u201cI never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies. He does know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting too much for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election, if he was not too tired. John saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn\u2019t keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon appear. He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet. In her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and when John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity, \u201cWell, I really don\u2019t see what we are coming to.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is trying to like politics for my sake, so I\u2019ll try and like millinery for hers, that\u2019s only fair,\u201d thought John the Just, adding aloud, \u201cThat\u2019s very pretty. Is it what you call a breakfast cap?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear man, it\u2019s a bonnet! My very best go-to-concert-and-theater bonnet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThese bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so,\u201d and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks young and happy again,\u201d and John kissed the smiling face, to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night. I really need some music to put me in tune. Will you, please?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like. You have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall enjoy it, of all things. What put it into your head, little mother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I\u2019m to see to things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before my time. It\u2019s only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your sake as much as for mine, because I\u2019ve neglected you shamefully lately, and I\u2019m going to make home what it used to be, if I can. You don\u2019t object, I hope?\u201d\r\n\r\nNever mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin. All that we have any business to know is that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates. It was not all Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of labor system. The children throve under the paternal rule, for accurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband. Home grew homelike again, and John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him. The Scotts came to the Brookes\u2019 now, and everyone found the little house a cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love. Even Sallie Moffatt liked to go there. \u201cIt is always so quiet and pleasant here, it does me good, Meg,\u201d she used to say, looking about her with wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use it in her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own, where there was no place for her.\r\n\r\nThis household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy. This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them, undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking side by side, through fair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true sense of the good old Saxon word, the \u2018house-band\u2019, and learning, as Meg learned, that a woman\u2019s happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-NINE\r\nLAZY LAURENCE\r\n\r\nLaurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month. He was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy\u2019s familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part. He rather missed the \u2018petting\u2019 he used to receive, and enjoyed a taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home. Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very glad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess. They naturally took comfort in each other\u2019s society and were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each other. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy tried to please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie made no effort of any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him. It cost him no effort to be generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the rest have gone to Monaco for the day. I preferred to stay at home and write letters. They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa to sketch, will you come?\u201d said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but isn\u2019t it rather warm for such a long walk?\u201d he answered slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so you\u2019ll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves nice,\u201d returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids, which were a weak point with Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go with pleasure.\u201d and he put out his hand for her sketchbook. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself. It\u2019s no exertion to me, but you don\u2019t look equal to it.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch.\r\n\r\nThe two never quarreled. Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air. She answered him with a smile, and they went on together in the most amicable manner.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery, whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.\r\n\r\nValrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and the white-walled city on its shore.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn\u2019t it? Did you ever see such roses?\u201d asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, nor felt such thorns,\u201d returned Laurie, with his thumb in his mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,\u201d said Amy, gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall behind her. She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy, when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself, but the next instant his American common sense got the better of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard since he came.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good advice, you\u2019d better take it and save your fingers,\u201d she said, thinking her speech amused him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I will,\u201d he answered in jest, and a few months later he did it in earnest.\r\n\r\n\u201cLaurie, when are you going to your grandfather?\u201d she asked presently, as she settled herself on a rustic seat.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery soon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say, short answers save trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe expects you, and you really ought to go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHospitable creature! I know it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you do it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNatural depravity, I suppose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNatural indolence, you mean. It\u2019s really dreadful!\u201d and Amy looked severe.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently,\u201d and Laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.\r\n\r\nAmy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture \u2018that boy\u2019 and in a minute she began again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing just now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWatching lizards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no. I mean what do you intend and wish to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmoke a cigarette, if you\u2019ll allow me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow provoking you are! I don\u2019t approve of cigars and I will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch. I need a figure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith all the pleasure in life. How will you have me, full length or three-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture, then put yourself in also and call it \u2018Dolce far niente\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. I intend to work hard,\u201d said Amy in her most energetic tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat delightful enthusiasm!\u201d and he leaned against a tall urn with an air of entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would Jo say if she saw you now?\u201d asked Amy impatiently, hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister\u2019s name.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs usual, \u2018Go away, Teddy. I\u2019m busy!\u2019\u201d He laughed as he spoke, but the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on Laurie\u2019s face\u2014a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and regret. It was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,\u201d she said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark stone.\r\n\r\n\u201cWish I was!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so changed, I sometimes think\u2014\u201d there Amy stopped, with a half-timid, half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.\r\n\r\nLaurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used to say it to her mother, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the cordial tone in which she said...\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of that! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d been a very bad boy, but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour. Don\u2019t stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the grass here and \u2018let us be friendly\u2019, as Jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy\u2019s hat, that lay there.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m all ready for the secrets.\u201d and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve none to tell. You may begin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you\u2019d had some news from home..\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have heard all that has come lately. Don\u2019t you hear often? I fancied Jo would send you volumes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s very busy. I\u2019m roving about so, it\u2019s impossible to be regular, you know. When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?\u201d he asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d she answered, with a despondent but decided air. \u201cRome took all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should you, with so much energy and talent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just why, because talent isn\u2019t genius, and no amount of energy can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won\u2019t be a common-place dauber, so I don\u2019t intend to try any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPolish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get the chance.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity becomes young people, and Amy\u2019s ambition had a good foundation. Laurie smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, \u201cNow I\u2019m going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t promise to answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour face will, if your tongue won\u2019t. You aren\u2019t woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred and you last year, and it\u2019s my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come of it, hey?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not for me to say,\u201d was Amy\u2019s grim reply, but her lips would smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not engaged, I hope?\u201d and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly and grave all of a sudden.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you are fond of old Fred?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could be, if I tried.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul, what unearthly prudence! He\u2019s a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I fancied you\u2019d like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,\u201d began Amy, trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of herself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand. Queens of society can\u2019t get on without money, so you mean to make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right and proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother\u2019s girls.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, nevertheless.\u201d\r\n\r\nA short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain. His look and silence, as well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,\u201d she said sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo it for me, there\u2019s a dear girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could, if I tried.\u201d and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry, then. I give you leave,\u201d returned Laurie, who enjoyed having someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d be angry in five minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire. You are as cool and soft as snow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I can do. Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if applied rightly. Your indifference is half affectation, and a good stirring up would prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStir away, it won\u2019t hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said when his little wife beat him. Regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeing decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and began.\r\n\r\n\u201cFlo and I have got a new name for you. It\u2019s Lazy Laurence. How do you like it?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under his head, with an imperturbable, \u201cThat\u2019s not bad. Thank you, ladies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you want to know what I honestly think of you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPining to be told.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I despise you.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf she had even said \u2018I hate you\u2019 in a petulant or coquettish tone, he would have laughed and rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad, accent in her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly...\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, if you please?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are faulty, lazy, and miserable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStrong language, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you like it, I\u2019ll go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do, it\u2019s quite interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d find it so. Selfish people always like to talk about themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I selfish?\u201d the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, very selfish,\u201d continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as effective just then as an angry one. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how, for I\u2019ve studied you while we were frolicking, and I\u2019m not at all satisfied with you. Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look as if you\u2019d had much. At any rate, you are none the better for it, as far as I can see. I said when we first met that you had improved. Now I take it all back, for I don\u2019t think you half so nice as when I left you at home. You have grown abominably lazy, you like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and respected by wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, and beauty, ah you like that old Vanity! But it\u2019s the truth, so I can\u2019t help saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you ought to be, you are only...\u201d there she stopped, with a look that had both pain and pity in it.\r\n\r\n\u201cSaint Laurence on a gridiron,\u201d added Laurie, blandly finishing the sentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured expression replaced the former indifference.\r\n\r\n\u201cI supposed you\u2019d take it so. You men tell us we are angels, and say we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try to do you good, you laugh at us and won\u2019t listen, which proves how much your flattery is worth.\u201d Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet.\r\n\r\nIn a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw, and Laurie\u2019s voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, \u201cI will be good, oh, I will be good!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of a hand like that? It\u2019s as soft and white as a woman\u2019s, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin\u2019s best gloves and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I\u2019m glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. She only saw his chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy\u2019s mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her. She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled the shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration, and now she was sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and when she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren\u2019t the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you\u2019d be very angry with me. But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn\u2019t bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps they would understand the change better than I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think they would,\u201d came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as touching as a broken one.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding, when I should have been more kind and patient than ever. I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!\u201d said artful Amy, wishing to be sure of her facts this time.\r\n\r\n\u201cHang Miss Randal!\u201d and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg pardon, I thought...\u201d and there she paused diplomatically.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but Jo,\u201d Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face away as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn\u2019t be kind to you? Why, I was sure she loved you dearly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was kind, but not in the right way, and it\u2019s lucky for her she didn\u2019t love me, if I\u2019m the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. It\u2019s her fault though, and you may tell her so.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was wrong, I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m very sorry I was so cross, but I can\u2019t help wishing you\u2019d bear it better, Teddy, dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t, that\u2019s her name for me!\u201d and Laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo\u2019s half-kind, half-reproachful tone. \u201cWait till you\u2019ve tried it yourself,\u201d he added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn\u2019t be loved,\u201d said Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nNow, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well, making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live it down alone. Amy\u2019s lecture put the matter in a new light, and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference. He felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again. Presently he sat up and asked slowly, \u201cDo you think Jo would despise me as you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don\u2019t you do something splendid, and make her love you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did my best, but it was no use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGraduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to have done, for your grandfather\u2019s sake. It would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you could do well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn\u2019t love me,\u201d began Laurie, leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t, and you\u2019ll say so in the end, for it did you good, and proved that you could do something if you tried. If you\u2019d only set about another task of some sort, you\u2019d soon be your hearty, happy self again, and forget your trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTry it and see. You needn\u2019t shrug your shoulders, and think, \u2018Much she knows about such things\u2019. I don\u2019t pretend to be wise, but I am observing, and I see a great deal more than you\u2019d imagine. I\u2019m interested in other people\u2019s experiences and inconsistencies, and though I can\u2019t explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit. Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don\u2019t let it spoil you, for it\u2019s wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can\u2019t have the one you want. There, I won\u2019t lecture any more, for I know you\u2019ll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.\u201d\r\n\r\nNeither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee, merely saying, \u201cHow do you like that?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer\u2019s head.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow well you draw!\u201d he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, \u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you are. This is as you were.\u201d and Amy laid another sketch beside the one he held.\r\n\r\nIt was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young man\u2019s face as he looked. Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse. Hat and coat were off, and every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider\u2019s breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the \u2018Dolce far Niente\u2019 sketch. Laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him. That satisfied her, and without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way...\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all looked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch obliged. You\u2019ve improved immensely since then, and I congratulate you. May I venture to suggest in \u2018a honeymoon paradise\u2019 that five o\u2019clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner, and said to herself...\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ve offended him. Well, if it does him good, I\u2019m glad, if it makes him hate me, I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s true, and I can\u2019t take back a word of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits. But both felt ill at ease. The friendly frankness was disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall we see you this evening, mon frere?\u201d asked Amy, as they parted at her aunt\u2019s door.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately I have an engagement. Au revoir, madamoiselle,\u201d and Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became him better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and warmly...\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I\u2019d rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental salutations in France.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodbye, dear,\u201d and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked, Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.\r\n\r\nNext morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself, for \u2018Lazy Laurence\u2019 has gone to his grandpa, like the best of boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations.\r\n\r\nYours gratefully, Telemachus\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy! I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gone,\u201d said Amy, with an approving smile. The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding, with an involuntary sigh, \u201cYes, I am glad, but how I shall miss him.\u201d\r\nCHAPTER FORTY\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW\r\n\r\nWhen the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable, and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble. They put away their grief, and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one.\r\n\r\nThe pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was gathered everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures, her piano, the little worktable, and the beloved pussies. Father\u2019s best books found their way there, Mother\u2019s easy chair, Jo\u2019s desk, Amy\u2019s finest sketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage, to make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart a little sum, that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for. Old Hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears as she worked, and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter.\r\n\r\nHere, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind. The feeble fingers were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had wanted any reward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look round, and say \u201cHow beautiful this is!\u201d as they all sat together in her sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and sisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as applicable now as when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation possible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of those who listened, for the father\u2019s heart was in the minister\u2019s religion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read.\r\n\r\nIt was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the needle was \u2018so heavy\u2019, and put it down forever. Talking wearied her, faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh. Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the bitter cry, \u201cHelp me, help me!\u201d and to feel that there was no help. A sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with death, but both were mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck of her frail body, Beth\u2019s soul grew strong, and though she said little, those about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore, trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river.\r\n\r\nJo never left her for an hour since Beth had said \u201cI feel stronger when you are here.\u201d She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything, and \u2018tried not to be a trouble\u2019. All day she haunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it needed. Lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them, charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly.\r\n\r\nOften when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music she loved so well.\r\n\r\nSeeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter. For with eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister\u2019s life\u2014uneventful, unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which \u2018smell sweet, and blossom in the dust\u2019, the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible to all.\r\n\r\nOne night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite, Pilgrims\u2019s Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo\u2019s hand. The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor Jo! She\u2019s fast asleep, so I won\u2019t wake her to ask leave. She shows me all her things, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll mind if I look at this\u201d, thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug, with the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.\r\n\r\nMY BETH\r\n\r\nSitting patient in the shadow\r\nTill the blessed light shall come,\r\nA serene and saintly presence\r\nSanctifies our troubled home.\r\nEarthly joys and hopes and sorrows\r\nBreak like ripples on the strand\r\nOf the deep and solemn river\r\nWhere her willing feet now stand.\r\n\r\nO my sister, passing from me,\r\nOut of human care and strife,\r\nLeave me, as a gift, those virtues\r\nWhich have beautified your life.\r\nDear, bequeath me that great patience\r\nWhich has power to sustain\r\nA cheerful, uncomplaining spirit\r\nIn its prison-house of pain.\r\n\r\nGive me, for I need it sorely,\r\nOf that courage, wise and sweet,\r\nWhich has made the path of duty\r\nGreen beneath your willing feet.\r\nGive me that unselfish nature,\r\nThat with charity divine\r\nCan pardon wrong for love\u2019s dear sake\u2014\r\nMeek heart, forgive me mine!\r\n\r\nThus our parting daily loseth\r\nSomething of its bitter pain,\r\nAnd while learning this hard lesson,\r\nMy great loss becomes my gain.\r\nFor the touch of grief will render\r\nMy wild nature more serene,\r\nGive to life new aspirations,\r\nA new trust in the unseen.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, safe across the river,\r\nI shall see forever more\r\nA beloved, household spirit\r\nWaiting for me on the shore.\r\nHope and faith, born of my sorrow,\r\nGuardian angels shall become,\r\nAnd the sister gone before me\r\nBy their hands shall lead me home.\r\n\r\nBlurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth\u2019s face, for her one regret had been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the despair she feared. As she sat with the paper folded between her hands, the charred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze, and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it. I knew you wouldn\u2019t care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?\u201d she asked, with wistful, humble earnestness.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Beth, so much, so much!\u201d and Jo\u2019s head went down upon the pillow beside her sister\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019d wasted my life. I\u2019m not so good as you make me, but I have tried to do right. And now, when it\u2019s too late to begin even to do better, it\u2019s such a comfort to know that someone loves me so much, and feels as if I\u2019d helped them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I couldn\u2019t let you go, but I\u2019m learning to feel that I don\u2019t lose you, that you\u2019ll be more to me than ever, and death can\u2019t part us, though it seems to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it cannot, and I don\u2019t fear it any longer, for I\u2019m sure I shall be your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever. You must take my place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother when I\u2019m gone. They will turn to you, don\u2019t fail them, and if it\u2019s hard to work alone, remember that I don\u2019t forget you, and that you\u2019ll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the end so easy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try, Beth.\u201d and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition, pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the immortality of love.\r\n\r\nSo the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back in time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, clung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and Mother guided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up to God.\r\n\r\nSeldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see visions, or depart with beatified countenances, and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the \u2018tide went out easily\u2019, and in the dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving look, one little sigh.\r\n\r\nWith tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom full of dread.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out, Jo\u2019s place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird sang blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow, a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked God that Beth was well at last.\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-ONE\r\nLEARNING TO FORGET\r\n\r\nAmy\u2019s lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it till long afterward. Men seldom do, for when women are the advisers, the lords of creation don\u2019t take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do. Then they act upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it. If it fails, they generously give her the whole. Laurie went back to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully, and he had better try it again. There was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received. Pride forbid, and whenever the longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impression\u2014\u201cI despise you.\u201d \u201cGo and do something splendid that will make her love you.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy, but then when a man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now, and though he should never cease to be a faithful mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously. Jo wouldn\u2019t love him, but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girl\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 had not spoiled his life. He had always meant to do something, and Amy\u2019s advice was quite unnecessary. He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred. That being done, he felt that he was ready to \u2018hide his stricken heart, and still toil on\u2019.\r\n\r\nAs Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose a Requiem which should harrow up Jo\u2019s soul and melt the heart of every hearer. Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends, and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself. But whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem was beyond him just at present. It was evident that his mind was not in working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying, for often in the middle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being.\r\n\r\nThen he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning, but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him. He wanted Jo for his heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned traitor, and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would only recall Jo\u2019s oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in the most unsentimental aspects\u2014beating mats with her head tied up in a bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold water over his passion a la Gummidge\u2014and an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn\u2019t be put into the opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a \u201cBless that girl, what a torment she is!\u201d and a clutch at his hair, as became a distracted composer.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging readiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his mind\u2019s eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and blue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well he might, for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman.\r\n\r\nThanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get some new ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter. He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. \u201cIt\u2019s genius simmering, perhaps. I\u2019ll let it simmer, and see what comes of it,\u201d he said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasn\u2019t genius, but something far more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart\u2019s grand operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own, played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again. Then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as the last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself...\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is right! Talent isn\u2019t genius, and you can\u2019t make it so. That music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I won\u2019t be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do?\u201d\r\n\r\nThat seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread. Now if ever, occurred an eligible opportunity for \u2018going to the devil\u2019, as he once forcibly expressed it, for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood them pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him, and say \u201cAll\u2019s well,\u201d kept him safe and steady.\r\n\r\nVery likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it, boys will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not expect miracles.\u201d I dare say you don\u2019t, Mrs. Grundy, but it\u2019s true nevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the longer the better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must. But mothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one, and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and showing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good women\u2019s eyes. If it is a feminine delusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it.\r\n\r\nLaurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb all his powers for years, but to his great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day. He refused to believe it at first, got angry with himself, and couldn\u2019t understand it, but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in spite of us. Laurie\u2019s heart wouldn\u2019t ache. The wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead of trying to forget, he found himself trying to remember. He had not foreseen this turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He was disgusted with himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze. There was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to pass away in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.\r\n\r\nAs the word \u2018brotherly\u2019 passed through his mind in one of his reveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before him...\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he was a great man, and when he couldn\u2019t have one sister he took the other, and was happy.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t! I haven\u2019t forgotten, I never can. I\u2019ll try again, and if that fails, why then...\u201d\r\n\r\nLeaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn\u2019t she, wouldn\u2019t she\u2014and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience. It came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo decidedly couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t. She was wrapped up in Beth, and never wished to hear the word love again. Then she begged him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay. That would be time enough, please God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel lonely, homesick or anxious.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I will, at once. Poor little girl, it will be a sad going home for her, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before.\r\n\r\nBut he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose. Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and business documents of various kinds were several of Jo\u2019s letters, and in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside. With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered up all Jo\u2019s letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan\u2019s, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.\r\n\r\nThe letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring. Laurie sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris, hoping somebody would arrive before long. He wanted desperately to go to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him, for just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of \u2018our boy\u2019.\r\n\r\nFred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once decided to answer, \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d but now she said, \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her, and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears. The words, \u201cFred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I fancied you would ever like,\u201d and Laurie\u2019s face when he uttered them, kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look, if not in words, \u201cI shall marry for money.\u201d It troubled her to remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so unwomanly. She didn\u2019t want Laurie to think her a heartless, worldly creature. She didn\u2019t care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman. She was so glad he didn\u2019t hate her for the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever. His letters were such a comfort, for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come. It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them, for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted in being stonyhearted. She ought to have made an effort and tried to love him. It couldn\u2019t be very hard, many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them. But Jo never would act like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother.\r\n\r\nIf all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they would be a much happier race of beings than they are. Amy never lectured now. She asked his opinion on all subjects, she was interested in everything he did, made charming little presents for him, and sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their sister\u2019s pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that Amy did any of these fond and foolish things. But she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went out sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHer aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to Egypt. That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he said to himself, with a venerable air...\r\n\r\n\u201cI was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I\u2019ve been through it all, and I can sympathize.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy\u2019s letter luxuriously.\r\n\r\nWhile these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home. But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and when the next found her the grass was green above her sister. The sad news met her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian lakes. She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit, for since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow. But her heart was very heavy, she longed to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her.\r\n\r\nHe did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them both, but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him. The moment he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow, hope and suspense.\r\n\r\nHe knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en pension. The garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting down, a flash of time should present her. But monsieur could not wait even a \u2018flash of time\u2019, and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself.\r\n\r\nA pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide, low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console herself with the beauty all about her. She was sitting here that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come. She did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen before, the tender side of Amy\u2019s character. Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing...\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you\u2019d come to me!\u201d\r\n\r\nI think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who could fill Jo\u2019s place and make him happy. He did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.\r\n\r\nIn a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears, Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future. As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to see you. It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn\u2019t come,\u201d she said, trying in vain to speak quite naturally.\r\n\r\n\u201cI came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...\u201d He could not get any further, for he too turned bashful all of a sudden, and did not quite know what to say. He longed to lay Amy\u2019s head down on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare, so took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t say anything, this comforts me,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBeth is well and happy, and I mustn\u2019t wish her back, but I dread the going home, much as I long to see them all. We won\u2019t talk about it now, for it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay. You needn\u2019t go right back, need you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot if you want me, dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like one of the family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what she wanted\u2014the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor little soul, you look as if you\u2019d grieved yourself half sick! I\u2019m going to take care of you, so don\u2019t cry any more, but come and walk about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,\u201d he said, in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts. He felt more at ease upon his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon, a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone.\r\n\r\nThe quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this new pair walked and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.\r\n\r\nThe moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl\u2019s altered face, she was illuminated with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, \u201cNow I understand it all\u2014the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my heart, I never thought of such a thing!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much solitude. Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it with more than her usual success.\r\n\r\nAt Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded. At Vevay, Laurie was never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could. He said the change was owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.\r\n\r\nThe invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills. The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists. The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts. The lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying, \u201cLittle children, love one another.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, and as he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo\u2019s sister was almost the same as Jo\u2019s self, and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret. He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be grateful when the pain was over. His second wooing, he resolved, should be as calm and simple as possible. There was no need of having a scene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, even Jo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance.\r\n\r\nHe had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been floating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged gulls.\r\n\r\nThey had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his Heloise. Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them, and when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for the sake of saying something...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must be tired. Rest a little, and let me row. It will do me good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like. There\u2019s room enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won\u2019t trim,\u201d returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.\r\n\r\nFeeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar. She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though she used both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went smoothly through the water.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow well we pull together, don\u2019t we?\u201d said Amy, who objected to silence just then.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you, Amy?\u201d very tenderly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Laurie,\u201d very low.\r\n\r\nThen they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake.\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-TWO\r\nALL ALONE\r\n\r\nIt was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example. But when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very hard to keep. How could she \u2018comfort Father and Mother\u2019 when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister, how could she \u2018make the house cheerful\u2019 when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home for the new, and where in all the world could she \u2018find some useful, happy work to do\u2019, that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow. It was not fair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble and hard work.\r\n\r\nPoor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I wasn\u2019t meant for a life like this, and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if somebody doesn\u2019t come and help me,\u201d she said to herself, when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.\r\n\r\nBut someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started up at night, thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, \u201cOh, Beth, come back! Come back!\u201d she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain. For, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister\u2019s faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo\u2019s, and broken whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing, which chastened grief and strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo\u2019s burden seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother\u2019s arms.\r\n\r\nWhen aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said very humbly, \u201cFather, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she did, for I\u2019m all wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear, nothing can comfort me like this,\u201d he answered, with a falter in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too, needed help, and did not fear to ask for it.\r\n\r\nThen, sitting in Beth\u2019s little chair close beside him, Jo told her troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair. She gave him entire confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation in the act. For the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. Happy, thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called \u2018the church of one member\u2019, and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit. For the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.\r\n\r\nOther helps had Jo\u2014humble, wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both, and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush, never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found herself humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth\u2019s orderly ways, and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she didn\u2019t know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou thoughtful creeter, you\u2019re determined we shan\u2019t miss that dear lamb ef you can help it. We don\u2019t say much, but we see it, and the Lord will bless you for\u2019t, see ef He don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and children, and how much they were all doing for each other.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?, always \u2018perwisin\u2019 I could,\u201d said Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy-turvy nursery.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature, Jo. You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it. Love will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr will fall off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrost opens chestnut burrs, ma\u2019am, and it takes a good shake to bring them down. Boys go nutting, and I don\u2019t care to be bagged by them,\u201d returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.\r\n\r\nMeg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo\u2019s old spirit, but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of Meg\u2019s most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly. Grief is the best opener of some hearts, and Jo\u2019s was nearly ready for the bag. A little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy\u2019s impatient shake, but a man\u2019s hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr, and find the kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately she wasn\u2019t thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she dropped.\r\n\r\nNow, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in her pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn\u2019t a heroine, she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just acted out her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood suggested. It\u2019s highly virtuous to say we\u2019ll be good, but we can\u2019t do it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way. Jo had got so far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing! She had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard, and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her? And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?\r\n\r\nProvidence had taken her at her word. Here was the task, not what she had expected, but better because self had no part in it. Now, could she do it? She decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she found the helps I have suggested. Still another was given her, and she took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed the hill called Difficulty.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you write? That always used to make you happy,\u201d said her mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do. Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world. Try it, dear. I\u2019m sure it would do you good, and please us very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe I can.\u201d But Jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her half-finished manuscripts.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success of her suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it, for when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it, much against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested. Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends admired it. For a small thing it was a great success, and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it. What can there be in a simple little story like that to make people praise it so?\u201d she said, quite bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is truth in it, Jo, that\u2019s the secret. Humor and pathos make it alive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote with no thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, my daughter. You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your best, and grow as happy as we are in your success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn\u2019t mine. I owe it all to you and Mother and Beth,\u201d said Jo, more touched by her father\u2019s words than by any amount of praise from the world.\r\n\r\nSo taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were kindly welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.\r\n\r\nWhen Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon set at rest, for though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for \u2018the children\u2019 before she read the letter twice. It was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection to make.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou like it, Mother?\u201d said Jo, as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused Fred. I felt sure then that something better than what you call the \u2018mercenary spirit\u2019 had come over her, and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a word to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your head, lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not the scatterbrain I was. You may trust me. I\u2019m sober and sensible enough for anyone\u2019s confidante now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish, after I\u2019d refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I can\u2019t help seeing that you are very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart. So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Mother, it is better as it is, and I\u2019m glad Amy has learned to love him. But you are right in one thing. I am lonely, and perhaps if Teddy had tried again, I might have said \u2018Yes\u2019, not because I love him any more, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father and Mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don\u2019t mind whispering to Marmee that I\u2019d like to try all kinds. It\u2019s very curious, but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the more I seem to want. I\u2019d no idea hearts could take in so many. Mine is so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite contented with my family. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me. He isn\u2019t sentimental, doesn\u2019t say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don\u2019t seem to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it\u2019s mine. He says he feels as if he \u2018could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast\u2019. I pray he may, and try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets us be together. Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world could be, when two people love and live for one another!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love does work miracles. How very, very happy they must be!\u201d and Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not walk. A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again, not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked, the other nothing. It was not true, she knew that and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for affection was strong, and Amy\u2019s happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to \u2018love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them be together\u2019. Up in the garret, where Jo\u2019s unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners name, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all. Jo glanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the edge, and stared absently at the chaotic collection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them over, and relived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke\u2019s. She had smiled at first, then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a little message written in the Professor\u2019s hand, her lips began to tremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a new meaning, and touched a tender spot in her heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always, my dear old Fritz. I didn\u2019t value him half enough when I had him, but now how I should love to see him, for everyone seems going away from me, and I\u2019m all alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag, and cried, as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.\r\n\r\nWas it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? Or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer? Who shall say?\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-THREE\r\nSURPRISES\r\n\r\nJo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the fire, and thinking. It was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk. No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth\u2019s little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her face looked tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how little she seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and nothing to show for it. Jo was mistaken in that. There was a good deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn old maid, that\u2019s what I\u2019m to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I\u2019m old and can\u2019t enjoy it, solitary, and can\u2019t share it, independent, and don\u2019t need it. Well, I needn\u2019t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say, old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but...\u201d and there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.\r\n\r\nIt seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to five-and-twenty. But it\u2019s not as bad as it looks, and one can get on quite happily if one has something in one\u2019s self to fall back upon. At twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly resolve that they never will be. At thirty they say nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don\u2019t laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces beautiful in God\u2019s sight. Even the sad, sour sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part of life, if for no other reason. And looking at them with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time. That rosy cheeks don\u2019t last forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for \u2018the best nevvy in the world\u2019.\r\n\r\nJo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this little homily), for suddenly Laurie\u2019s ghost seemed to stand before her, a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn\u2019t like to show it. But, like Jenny in the ballad...\r\n\r\n\u201cShe could not think it he,\u201d\r\n\r\nand lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and kissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully...\r\n\r\n\u201cOh my Teddy! Oh my Teddy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGlad! My blessed boy, words can\u2019t express my gladness. Where\u2019s Amy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour mother has got her down at Meg\u2019s. We stopped there by the way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour what?\u201d cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the dickens! Now I\u2019ve done it,\u201d and he looked so guilty that Jo was down on him like a flash.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gone and got married!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, please, but I never will again,\u201d and he went down upon his knees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth, and triumph.\r\n\r\n\u201cActually married?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so, thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy on us. What dreadful thing will you do next?\u201d and Jo fell into her seat with a gasp.\r\n\r\n\u201cA characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,\u201d returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can you expect, when you take one\u2019s breath away, creeping in like a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to barricade.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, \u201cThe old pillow is up garret, and we don\u2019t need it now. So, come and \u2019fess, Teddy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow good it sounds to hear you say \u2018Teddy\u2019! No one ever calls me that but you,\u201d and Laurie sat down with an air of great content.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does Amy call you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy lord.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s like her. Well, you look it,\u201d and Jo\u2019s eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever.\r\n\r\nThe pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them. It was gone directly however, for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at dignity...\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I look like a married man and the head of a family?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit, and you never will. You\u2019ve grown bigger and bonnier, but you are the same scapegrace as ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\u201d began Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so irresistibly funny that I can\u2019t keep sober!\u201d answered Jo, smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all coming up presently. I couldn\u2019t wait. I wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise, and have \u2018first skim\u2019 as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end. Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I\u2019m pining to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I did it to please Amy,\u201d began Laurie, with a twinkle that made Jo exclaim...\r\n\r\n\u201cFib number one. Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth, if you can, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow she\u2019s beginning to marm it. Isn\u2019t it jolly to hear her?\u201d said Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But Grandpa wanted to come home. He went to please me, and I couldn\u2019t let him go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn\u2019t let Amy come with us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, \u2018Let\u2019s be married, and then we can do as we like\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you did. You always have things to suit you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot always,\u201d and something in Laurie\u2019s voice made Jo say hastily...\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you ever get Aunt to agree?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps of good reasons on our side. There wasn\u2019t time to write and ask leave, but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only \u2018taking time by the fetlock\u2019, as my wife says.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t we proud of those two words, and don\u2019t we like to say them?\u201d interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.\r\n\r\n\u201cA trifle, perhaps, she\u2019s such a captivating little woman I can\u2019t help being proud of her. Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play propriety. We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round, so we did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen, where, how?\u201d asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.\r\n\r\n\u201cSix weeks ago, at the American consul\u2019s, in Paris, a very quiet wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn\u2019t forget dear little Beth.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow, which he remembered well.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let us know afterward?\u201d asked Jo, in a quieter tone, when they had sat quite still a minute.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe wanted to surprise you. We thought we were coming directly home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found he couldn\u2019t be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but once in their lives. My faith! Wasn\u2019t it love among the roses!\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before...\r\n\r\n\u201cJo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we\u2019ll put it by forever. As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places in my heart, that\u2019s all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I never could be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that I didn\u2019t know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love you both alike. But I couldn\u2019t, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy and girl again. The happy old times can\u2019t come back, and we mustn\u2019t expect it. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking. I\u2019m sure you feel this. I see the change in you, and you\u2019ll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be what I hoped he would. We can\u2019t be little playmates any longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives, won\u2019t we, Laurie?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn\u2019t want the coming home to be a sad one, \u201cI can\u2019t make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning Amy\u2019s pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how time does fly!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs one of the children is older than yourself, you needn\u2019t talk so like a grandma. I flatter myself I\u2019m a \u2018gentleman growed\u2019 as Peggotty said of David, and when you see Amy, you\u2019ll find her rather a precocious infant,\u201d said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may be a little older in years, but I\u2019m ever so much older in feeling, Teddy. Women always are, and this last year has been such a hard one that I feel forty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor Jo! We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You are older. Here\u2019s a line, and there\u2019s another. Unless you smile, your eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear on it. You\u2019ve had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone. What a selfish beast I\u2019ve been!\u201d and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a remorseful look.\r\n\r\nBut Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful, \u201cNo, I had Father and Mother to help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear. I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it\u2019s good for me, and...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou never shall be again,\u201d broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her, as if to fence out every human ill. \u201cAmy and I can\u2019t get on without you, so you must come and teach \u2018the children\u2019 to keep house, and go halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and all be blissfully happy and friendly together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I shouldn\u2019t be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I begin to feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy,\u201d and Jo leaned her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold on to him.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and laughing the next. You look a little wicked now. What is it, Grandma?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was wondering how you and Amy get on together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLike angels!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, of course, but which rules?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think so, it pleases her, you know. By-and-by we shall take turns, for marriage, they say, halves one\u2019s rights and doubles one\u2019s duties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she does it so imperceptibly that I don\u2019t think I shall mind much. She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well. In fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it!\u201d cried Jo, with uplifted hands.\r\n\r\nIt was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his \u201chigh and mighty\u201d air, \u201cAmy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of man to submit to it. My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure of that. Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man best, you remember.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe can blow him up as well as shine on him,\u201d laughed Laurie. \u201cSuch a lecture as I got at Nice! I give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your scoldings, a regular rouser. I\u2019ll tell you all about it sometime, she never will, because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the good-for-nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat baseness! Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I\u2019ll defend you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI look as if I needed it, don\u2019t I?\u201d said Laurie, getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous, as Amy\u2019s voice was heard calling, \u201cWhere is she? Where\u2019s my dear old Jo?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale and hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever. It was good to see him beam at \u2018my children\u2019, as he called the young pair. It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all, to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made.\r\n\r\nThe minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own dress hadn\u2019t a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that \u2018her ladyship\u2019 was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as she watched the pair, \u201cHow well they look together! I was right, and Laurie has found the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.\u201d Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.\r\n\r\nFor Amy\u2019s face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool, prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become.\r\n\r\n\u201cLove has done much for our little girl,\u201d said her mother softly.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,\u201d Mr. March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him.\r\n\r\nDaisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her \u2018pitty aunty\u2019, but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew where to have him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face. Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,\u201d and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlest if she ain\u2019t in silk from head to foot; ain\u2019t it a relishin\u2019 sight to see her settin\u2019 there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks calling little Amy \u2018Mis. Laurence!\u2019\u201d muttered old Hannah, who could not resist frequent \u201cpeeks\u201d through the slide as she set the table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner.\r\n\r\nMercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all burst out together\u2014trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and provide refreshment\u2014for they would have been hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence. Mrs. March as proudly leaned on the arm of \u2018my son\u2019. The old gentleman took Jo, with a whispered, \u201cYou must be my girl now,\u201d and a glance at the empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, \u201cI\u2019ll try to fill her place, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity. Didn\u2019t they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn\u2019t they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo\u2019s sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little sinners attached themselves to \u2018Dranpa\u2019, who hadn\u2019t his spectacles on. Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on Father Laurence\u2019s arm. The others paired off as before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah\u2019s eager inquiry.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver dishes that\u2019s stored away over yander?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing too good for her,\u201d returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more there is! Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?\u201d asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above, and as Demi\u2019s short plaid legs toiled up the last stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon, for even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to herself, \u201cI\u2019ll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won\u2019t do to be dismal now.\u201d Then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door.\r\n\r\nShe opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!\u201d cried Jo, with a clutch, as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,\u201d and the Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t, only the family. My sister and friends have just come home, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us.\u201d\r\n\r\nThough a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously away, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him, and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all. You haf been ill, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that,\u201d and he shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big, warm hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cFather, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,\u201d she said, with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.\r\n\r\nIf the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted him kindly, for Jo\u2019s sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his own. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once, feeling even the more friendly because he was poor. For poverty enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself at home. The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The women telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his guest\u2019s benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nIf Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie\u2019s behavior would have amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long. He got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn into the circle. For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere, and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it. But Jo had her own eyes to take care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.\r\n\r\nA stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer\u2019s face had lost the absent-minded expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she watched her father\u2019s absorbed face, \u201cHow he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!\u201d Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but didn\u2019t stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear old fellow! He couldn\u2019t have got himself up with more care if he\u2019d been going a-wooing,\u201d said Jo to herself, and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.\r\n\r\nThe maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the little blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.\r\n\r\nNobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches, made a move to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together again once more,\u201d said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.\r\n\r\nThey were not all there. But no one found the words thoughtless or untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence, invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the household league that love made dissoluble. The little chair stood in its old place. The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew \u2018so heavy\u2019, was still on its accustomed shelf. The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved, and above it Beth\u2019s face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon them, seeming to say, \u201cBe happy. I am here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlay something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved,\u201d said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.\r\n\r\nBut Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, \u201cNot tonight, dear. I can\u2019t show off tonight.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she sang Beth\u2019s songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught, and touched the listener\u2019s hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth\u2019s favorite hymn. It was hard to say...\r\n\r\nEarth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;\r\n\r\nand Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth\u2019s kiss.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, we must finish with Mignon\u2019s song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,\u201d said Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified \u201cHem!\u201d as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood, saying...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will sing with me? We go excellently well together.\u201d\r\n\r\nA pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a grasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune. It didn\u2019t much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.\r\n\r\nKnow\u2019st thou the land where the citron blooms,\r\n\r\nused to be the Professor\u2019s favorite line, for \u2018das land\u2019 meant Germany to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody, upon the words...\r\n\r\nThere, oh there, might I with thee,\r\nO, my beloved, go\r\n\r\nand one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked.\r\n\r\nThe song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been introduced simply as \u2018my sister\u2019, and no one had called her by her new name since he came. He forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting...\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\r\n\r\n\u201cI too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here some days.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother\u2019s voice gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter\u2019s eyes, for Mrs. March was not so blind to her children\u2019s interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suspect that is a wise man,\u201d remarked Mr. March, with placid satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know he is a good one,\u201d added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as she wound up the clock.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d like him,\u201d was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her bed.\r\n\r\nShe wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city, and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-FOUR\r\nMY LORD AND LADY\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The luggage has come, and I\u2019ve been making hay of Amy\u2019s Paris finery, trying to find some things I want,\u201d said Laurie, coming in the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother\u2019s lap, as if being made \u2018the baby\u2019 again.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,\u201d and Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come over if I could have helped it, but I can\u2019t get on without my little woman any more than a...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWeathercock can without the wind,\u201d suggested Jo, as he paused for a simile. Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came home.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven\u2019t had an easterly spell since I was married. Don\u2019t know anything about the north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLovely weather so far. I don\u2019t know how long it will last, but I\u2019m not afraid of storms, for I\u2019m learning how to sail my ship. Come home, dear, and I\u2019ll find your bootjack. I suppose that\u2019s what you are rummaging after among my things. Men are so helpless, Mother,\u201d said Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her husband.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?\u201d asked Jo, buttoning Amy\u2019s cloak as she used to button her pinafores.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have our plans. We don\u2019t mean to say much about them yet, because we are such very new brooms, but we don\u2019t intend to be idle. I\u2019m going into business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove to him that I\u2019m not spoiled. I need something of the sort to keep me steady. I\u2019m tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Amy, what is she going to do?\u201d asked Mrs. March, well pleased at Laurie\u2019s decision and the energy with which he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall exert over the world at large. That\u2019s about it, isn\u2019t it, Madame Recamier?\u201d asked Laurie with a quizzical look at Amy.\r\n\r\n\u201cTime will show. Come away, Impertinence, and don\u2019t shock my family by calling me names before their faces,\u201d answered Amy, resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow happy those children seem together!\u201d observed Mr. March, finding it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple had gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I think it will last,\u201d added Mrs. March, with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it will. Happy Amy!\u201d and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, \u201cMrs. Laurence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Lord!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat man intends to marry our Jo!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so, don\u2019t you, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Laurie, don\u2019t be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love one another it doesn\u2019t matter a particle how old they are nor how poor. Women never should marry for money...\u201d Amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with malicious gravity...\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought it your duty to make a rich match. That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a good-for-nothing like me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my dearest boy, don\u2019t, don\u2019t say that! I forgot you were rich when I said \u2018Yes\u2019. I\u2019d have married you if you hadn\u2019t a penny, and I sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you.\u201d And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private, gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be once, do you? It would break my heart if you didn\u2019t believe that I\u2019d gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you refused a richer man for me, and won\u2019t let me give you half I want to now, when I have the right? Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the daughter was true to the mother\u2019s teaching. I told Mamma so yesterday, and she looked as glad and grateful as if I\u2019d given her a check for a million, to be spent in charity. You are not listening to my moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence,\u201d and Laurie paused, for Amy\u2019s eyes had an absent look, though fixed upon his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time. I don\u2019t wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I\u2019m prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money. Don\u2019t laugh, but your nose is such a comfort to me,\u201d and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature with artistic satisfaction.\r\n\r\nLaurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his wife\u2019s peculiar taste, while she said slowly, \u201cMay I ask you a question, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, you may.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s the trouble is it? I thought there was something in the dimple that didn\u2019t quite suit you. Not being a dog in the manger, but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo\u2019s wedding with a heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my darling?\u201d\r\n\r\nAmy looked up at him, and was satisfied. Her little jealous fear vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and confidence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn\u2019t we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?\u201d said Laurie, when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo would find us out, and spoil it all. She is very proud of him, just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBless her dear heart! She won\u2019t think so when she has a literary husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support. We won\u2019t interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she believes in people\u2019s paying their honest debts, so I\u2019ll get round her in that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow delightful it is to be able to help others, isn\u2019t it? That was always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely, and thanks to you, the dream has come true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, we\u2019ll do quantities of good, won\u2019t we? There\u2019s one sort of poverty that I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won\u2019t ask, and people don\u2019t dare to offer charity. Yet there are a thousand ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend. I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar. I suppose it\u2019s wrong, but I do, though it is harder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it takes a gentleman to do it,\u201d added the other member of the domestic admiration society.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t deserve that pretty compliment. But I was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid fellows, some of them, working like heros, poor and friendless, but so full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself, and longed to give them a right good lift. Those are people whom it\u2019s a satisfaction to help, for if they\u2019ve got genius, it\u2019s an honor to be allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling. If they haven\u2019t, it\u2019s a pleasure to comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed, and there\u2019s another class who can\u2019t ask, and who suffer in silence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in the old story. Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see youth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a little help at the right minute. People have been very kind to me, and whenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand and help them, as I was helped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so you shall, like an angel as you are!\u201d cried Laurie, resolving, with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies. \u201cRich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their money accumulate for others to waste. It\u2019s not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive, and enjoy making one\u2019s fellow creatures happy with it. We\u2019ll have a good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas, going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with good deeds?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again, feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough ways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they.\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-FIVE\r\nDAISY AND DEMI\r\n\r\nI cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their elders do. If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two years they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy demanded a \u2018needler\u2019, and actually made a bag with four stitches in it. She likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah\u2019s eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his \u2018sewinsheen\u2019, a mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for wheels to go \u2018wound and wound\u2019. Also a basket hung over the back of a chair, in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, \u201cWhy, Marmar, dat\u2019s my lellywaiter, and me\u2019s trying to pull her up.\u201d\r\n\r\nThough utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody\u2019s heart, and nestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone, \u201cOh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!\u201d Everyone was a friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful worshipers.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe loves evvybody,\u201d she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world.\r\n\r\nAs she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often called her \u2018Beth\u2019, and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could see.\r\n\r\nDemi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual \u201cWhat for?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes my legs go, Dranpa?\u201d asked the young philosopher, surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting after a go-to-bed frolic one night.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your little mind, Demi,\u201d replied the sage, stroking the yellow head respectfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is a little mine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen me. I want to see it go wound.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that any more than you could open the watch. God winds you up, and you go till He stops you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes I?\u201d and Demi\u2019s brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought. \u201cIs I wounded up like the watch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I can\u2019t show you how, for it is done when we don\u2019t see.\u201d\r\n\r\nDemi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the watch, and then gravely remarked, \u201cI dess Dod does it when I\u2019s asleep.\u201d\r\n\r\nA careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively that his anxious grandmother said, \u201cMy dear, do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby? He\u2019s getting great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive true answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping him unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are, and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him. Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf the boy had replied like Alcibiades, \u201cBy the gods, Socrates, I cannot tell,\u201d his grandfather would not have been surprised, but when, after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he answered, in a tone of calm conviction, \u201cIn my little belly,\u201d the old gentleman could only join in Grandma\u2019s laugh, and dismiss the class in metaphysics.\r\n\r\nThere might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding philosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to prophesy, with ominous nods, \u201cThat child ain\u2019t long for this world,\u201d he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their parent\u2019s souls.\r\n\r\nMeg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what mother was ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more raisins, Demi. They\u2019ll make you sick,\u201d says Mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity on plum-pudding day.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe likes to be sick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit, and by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits Mamma by a shrewd bargain.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you have been good children, and I\u2019ll play anything you like,\u201d says Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot.\r\n\r\n\u201cTruly, Marmar?\u201d asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, truly. Anything you say,\u201d replies the shortsighted parent, preparing herself to sing, \u201cThe Three Little Kittens\u201d half a dozen times over, or to take her family to \u201cBuy a penny bun,\u201d regardless of wind or limb. But Demi corners her by the cool reply...\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll go and eat up all the raisins.\u201d\r\n\r\nAunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and the trio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for which compliment she was deeply grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their little souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost her best customer and became bankrupt. Demi, with infantile penetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play with \u2018the bear-man\u2019 better than she did him, but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he hadn\u2019t the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.\r\n\r\nSome persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes, but Demi didn\u2019t see it in that light, and continued to patronize the \u2018the bear-man\u2019 with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures surpassing worth.\r\n\r\nGentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer\u2019s devotion was sincere, however likewise effective\u2014for honesty is the best policy in love as in law. He was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one. His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see\u2014well, he always asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction. The excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study, astonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone upon the floor lay Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him, likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face...\r\n\r\n\u201cFather, Father, here\u2019s the Professor!\u201d\r\n\r\nDown went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor said, with undisturbed dignity, \u201cGood evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for a moment. We are just finishing our lesson. Now, Demi, make the letter and tell its name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knows him!\u201d and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a We, Dranpa, it\u2019s a We!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a born Weller,\u201d laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up, and her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you been at today, bubchen?\u201d asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the gymnast.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe went to see little Mary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI kissed her,\u201d began Demi, with artless frankness.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrut! Thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to that?\u201d asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. Don\u2019t little boys like little girls?\u201d asked Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of bland satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou precocious chick! Who put that into your head?\u201d said Jo, enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t in mine head, it\u2019s in mine mouf,\u201d answered literal Demi, putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking she alluded to confectionery, not ideas.\r\n\r\n\u201cThou shouldst save some for the little friend. Sweets to the sweet, mannling,\u201d and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy inquired. ..\r\n\r\n\u201cDo great boys like great girls, to, \u2019Fessor?\u201d\r\n\r\nLike young Washington, Mr. Bhaer \u2018couldn\u2019t tell a lie\u2019, so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at Jo\u2019s retiring face, and then sink into his chair, looking as if the \u2018precocious chick\u2019 had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour.\r\n\r\nWhy Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-SIX\r\nUNDER THE UMBRELLA\r\n\r\nWhile Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets, as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy roads and sodden fields.\r\n\r\n\u201cI always do take a walk toward evening, and I don\u2019t know why I should give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor on his way out,\u201d said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters, for though there were two paths to Meg\u2019s whichever one she took she was sure to meet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her until quite close, when he would look as if his short-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment. Then, if she was going to Meg\u2019s he always had something for the babies. If her face was turned homeward, he had merely strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless they were tired of his frequent calls.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and invite him in? If she was tired of his visits, she concealed her weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee for supper, \u201cas Friedrich\u2014I mean Mr. Bhaer\u2014doesn\u2019t like tea.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on, yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in Jo\u2019s face. They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise. And no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter lessons in love.\r\n\r\nJo couldn\u2019t even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried to quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated life. She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering, after her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her especial dread, but thanks to the new manager, he behaved with praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer \u2018a capital old fellow\u2019 in public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo\u2019s improved appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor\u2019s hat on the Marches\u2019 table nearly every evening. But he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity. Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to become pensive, at first, and then\u2014alas for romance\u2014very cross.\r\n\r\n\u201cDisgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It\u2019s nothing to me, of course, but I should think he would have come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman,\u201d she said to herself, with a despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better take the little umbrella, dear. It looks like rain,\u201d said her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not alluding to the fact.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Marmee, do you want anything in town? I\u2019ve got to run in and get some paper,\u201d returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d answered Jo absently.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long to see the dear man,\u201d added Mrs. March.\r\n\r\nJo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her heartache, \u201cHow good she is to me! What do girls do who haven\u2019t any mothers to help them through their troubles?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks, and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate, but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand, loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another, with most unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered \u2018how the deuce she got there\u2019. A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons. For the drops continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she felt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her bonnet. Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing, and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. She looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked with black, forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with \u2018Hoffmann, Swartz, & Co.\u2019 over the door, and said to herself, with a sternly reproachful air...\r\n\r\n\u201cIt serves me right! what business had I to put on all my best things and come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor? Jo, I\u2019m ashamed of you! No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain, and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet, it\u2019s no more than you deserve. Now then!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, \u201cI beg pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d and looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself, spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and putting temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many horse noses, and so fast through much mud. What do you down here, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m shopping.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he only said politely, \u201cYou haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take for you the bundles?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo\u2019s cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought of her, but she didn\u2019t care, for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe thought you had gone,\u201d said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking at her. Her bonnet wasn\u2019t big enough to hide her face, and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me?\u201d he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily...\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we rather missed you, Father and Mother especially.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m always glad to see you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely...\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you, and come one more time before I go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haf no longer any business here, it is done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuccessfully, I hope?\u201d said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make my bread and gif my Junglings much help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me, please! I like to know all about the\u2014the boys,\u201d said Jo eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a place in a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way smooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be grateful, should I not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing what you like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!\u201d cried Jo, clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far away!\u201d and Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn\u2019t matter now what became of her clothes or herself.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read women yet. He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was, therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour. When she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose. When he offered her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell upon him. On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands. Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his destination, she said, \u201cSo far away!\u201d in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter...\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the place for my errands. Will you come in? It won\u2019t take long.\u201d\r\n\r\nJo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the flutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray of needles, forgot the silesia was to be \u2018twilled\u2019 till it was cut off, gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women, like dreams, go by contraries.\r\n\r\nWhen they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole.\r\n\r\n\u201cShould we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so pleasant home?\u201d he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will we buy?\u201d asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech, and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went in.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay they haf oranges and figs?\u201d asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey eat them when they can get them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you care for nuts?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLike a squirrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHamburg grapes. Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?\u201d\r\n\r\nJo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn\u2019t buy a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and be done with it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own, and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a demijohn. Then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they traveled on again.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,\u201d began the Professor, after a moist promenade of half a block.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d and Jo\u2019s heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time remains to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go alone. Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps also a shawl for Tina\u2019s mother, she is so poor and sick, and the husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going very fast, and he\u2019s getting dearer every minute,\u201d added Jo to herself, then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to behold.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and then ordered out the shawls. The clerk, being a married man, condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be shopping for their family.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour lady may prefer this. It\u2019s a superior article, a most desirable color, quite chaste and genteel,\u201d he said, shaking out a comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo\u2019s shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?\u201d she asked, turning her back to him, and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellently well, we will haf it,\u201d answered the Professor, smiling to himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters like a confirmed bargain-hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow shall we go home?\u201d he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s late, and I\u2019m so tired.\u201d Jo\u2019s voice was more pathetic than she knew. For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and that her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the latter. Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend, it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better. With this idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is not our omniboos,\u201d said the Professor, waving the loaded vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon. I didn\u2019t see the name distinctly. Never mind, I can walk. I\u2019m used to plodding in the mud,\u201d returned Jo, winking hard, because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away. The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, \u201cHeart\u2019s dearest, why do you cry?\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasn\u2019t crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion. Instead of which, that undignified creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, \u201cBecause you are going away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAch, mein Gott, that is so good!\u201d cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, \u201cJo, I haf nothing but much love to gif you. I came to see if you could care for it, and I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend. Am I? Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?\u201d he added, all in one breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him, even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he carried it.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on account of the mud. Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except figuratively, for both were full. Much less could he indulge in tender remonstrations in the open street, though he was near it. So the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard. If he had not loved Jo very much, I don\u2019t think he could have done it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her bonnet a ruin. Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living, and she found him more \u201cJove-like\u201d than ever, though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed mending.\r\n\r\nPassers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious of deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody thought, for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss. While Jo trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first to speak\u2014intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous \u201cOh, yes!\u201d were not of a coherent or reportable character.\r\n\r\n\u201cFriedrich, why didn\u2019t you...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!\u201d cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful delight.\r\n\r\n\u201cI always call you so to myself\u2014I forgot, but I won\u2019t unless you like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLike it? It is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say \u2018thou\u2019, also, and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t \u2018thou\u2019 a little sentimental?\u201d asked Jo, privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable.\r\n\r\n\u201cSentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and keep ourselves young mit it. Your English \u2018you\u2019 is so cold, say \u2018thou\u2019, heart\u2019s dearest, it means so much to me,\u201d pleaded Mr. Bhaer, more like a romantic student than a grave professor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, why didn\u2019t thou tell me all this sooner?\u201d asked Jo bashfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will, because thou must take care of it hereafter. See, then, my Jo\u2014ah, the dear, funny little name\u2014I had a wish to tell something the day I said goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee, and so I spoke not. Wouldst thou have said \u2018Yes\u2019, then, if I had spoken?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m afraid not, for I didn\u2019t have any heart just then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrut! That I do not believe. It was asleep till the fairy prince came through the wood, and waked it up. Ah, well, \u2018Die erste Liebe ist die beste\u2019, but that I should not expect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I never had another. Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy,\u201d said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor\u2019s mistake.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all. I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find, Professorin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI like that,\u201d cried Jo, delighted with her new name. \u201cNow tell me what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nJo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could that bring you?\u201d she asked, wondering what he meant.\r\n\r\n\u201cI found it by chance. I knew it by the names and the initials, and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me. Read and find him. I will see that you go not in the wet.\u201d\r\n\r\nIN THE GARRET\r\n\r\nFour little chests all in a row,\r\nDim with dust, and worn by time,\r\nAll fashioned and filled, long ago,\r\nBy children now in their prime.\r\nFour little keys hung side by side,\r\nWith faded ribbons, brave and gay\r\nWhen fastened there, with childish pride,\r\nLong ago, on a rainy day.\r\nFour little names, one on each lid,\r\nCarved out by a boyish hand,\r\nAnd underneath there lieth hid\r\nHistories of the happy band\r\nOnce playing here, and pausing oft\r\nTo hear the sweet refrain,\r\nThat came and went on the roof aloft,\r\nIn the falling summer rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cMeg\u201d on the first lid, smooth and fair.\r\nI look in with loving eyes,\r\nFor folded here, with well-known care,\r\nA goodly gathering lies,\r\nThe record of a peaceful life\u2014\r\nGifts to gentle child and girl,\r\nA bridal gown, lines to a wife,\r\nA tiny shoe, a baby curl.\r\nNo toys in this first chest remain,\r\nFor all are carried away,\r\nIn their old age, to join again\r\nIn another small Meg\u2019s play.\r\nAh, happy mother! Well I know\r\nYou hear, like a sweet refrain,\r\nLullabies ever soft and low\r\nIn the falling summer rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo\u201d on the next lid, scratched and worn,\r\nAnd within a motley store\r\nOf headless dolls, of schoolbooks torn,\r\nBirds and beasts that speak no more,\r\nSpoils brought home from the fairy ground\r\nOnly trod by youthful feet,\r\nDreams of a future never found,\r\nMemories of a past still sweet,\r\nHalf-writ poems, stories wild,\r\nApril letters, warm and cold,\r\nDiaries of a wilful child,\r\nHints of a woman early old,\r\nA woman in a lonely home,\r\nHearing, like a sad refrain\u2014\r\n\u201cBe worthy, love, and love will come,\u201d\r\nIn the falling summer rain.\r\n\r\nMy Beth! the dust is always swept\r\nFrom the lid that bears your name,\r\nAs if by loving eyes that wept,\r\nBy careful hands that often came.\r\nDeath canonized for us one saint,\r\nEver less human than divine,\r\nAnd still we lay, with tender plaint,\r\nRelics in this household shrine\u2014\r\nThe silver bell, so seldom rung,\r\nThe little cap which last she wore,\r\nThe fair, dead Catherine that hung\r\nBy angels borne above her door.\r\nThe songs she sang, without lament,\r\nIn her prison-house of pain,\r\nForever are they sweetly blent\r\nWith the falling summer rain.\r\n\r\nUpon the last lid\u2019s polished field\u2014\r\nLegend now both fair and true\r\nA gallant knight bears on his shield,\r\n\u201cAmy\u201d in letters gold and blue.\r\nWithin lie snoods that bound her hair,\r\nSlippers that have danced their last,\r\nFaded flowers laid by with care,\r\nFans whose airy toils are past,\r\nGay valentines, all ardent flames,\r\nTrifles that have borne their part\r\nIn girlish hopes and fears and shames,\r\nThe record of a maiden heart\r\nNow learning fairer, truer spells,\r\nHearing, like a blithe refrain,\r\nThe silver sound of bridal bells\r\nIn the falling summer rain.\r\n\r\nFour little chests all in a row,\r\nDim with dust, and worn by time,\r\nFour women, taught by weal and woe\r\nTo love and labor in their prime.\r\nFour sisters, parted for an hour,\r\nNone lost, one only gone before,\r\nMade by love\u2019s immortal power,\r\nNearest and dearest evermore.\r\nOh, when these hidden stores of ours\r\nLie open to the Father\u2019s sight,\r\nMay they be rich in golden hours,\r\nDeeds that show fairer for the light,\r\nLives whose brave music long shall ring,\r\nLike a spirit-stirring strain,\r\nSouls that shall gladly soar and sing\r\nIn the long sunshine after rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day when I was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag. I never thought it would go where it could tell tales,\u201d said Jo, tearing up the verses the Professor had treasured so long.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets,\u201d said Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind. \u201cYes,\u201d he added earnestly, \u201cI read that, and I think to myself, She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love. I haf a heart full, full for her. Shall I not go and say, \u2018If this is not too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it in Gott\u2019s name?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious thing I needed,\u201d whispered Jo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your welcome to me. But soon I began to hope, and then I said, \u2018I will haf her if I die for it,\u2019 and so I will!\u201d cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down.\r\n\r\nJo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight, though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat made you stay away so long?\u201d she asked presently, finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to gif you, after much time, perhaps, and hard work. How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you are poor. I couldn\u2019t bear a rich husband,\u201d said Jo decidedly, adding in a softer tone, \u201cDon\u2019t fear poverty. I\u2019ve known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those I love, and don\u2019t call yourself old\u2014forty is the prime of life. I couldn\u2019t help loving you if you were seventy!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief, if he could have got at it. As he couldn\u2019t, Jo wiped his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or two...\r\n\r\n\u201cI may be strong-minded, but no one can say I\u2019m out of my sphere now, for woman\u2019s special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens. I\u2019m to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home. Make up your mind to that, or I\u2019ll never go,\u201d she added resolutely, as he tried to reclaim his load.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see. Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go away and do my work alone. I must help my boys first, because, even for you, I may not break my word to Minna. Can you forgif that, and be happy while we hope and wait?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all the rest easy to bear. I have my duty, also, and my work. I couldn\u2019t enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you, so there\u2019s no need of hurry or impatience. You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and both be happy hoping for the best, and leaving the future to be as God wills.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands,\u201d cried the Professor, quite overcome.\r\n\r\nJo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said that as they stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispering tenderly, \u201cNot empty now,\u201d and stooping down, kissed her Friedrich under the umbrella. It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings, for she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that was the crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them, with a glad \u201cWelcome home!\u201d Jo led her lover in, and shut the door.\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN\r\nHARVEST TIME\r\n\r\nFor a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The second year began rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March died suddenly. But when their first sorrow was over\u2014for they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue\u2014they found they had cause for rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of joyful things possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of course you intend to sell it,\u201d said Laurie, as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d was Jo\u2019s decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle, whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to live there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, my dear girl, it\u2019s an immense house, and will take a power of money to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone need two or three men, and farming isn\u2019t in Bhaer\u2019s line, I take it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that sounds paradisiacal, but you\u2019ll find it desperate hard work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe crop we are going to raise is a profitable one,\u201d and Jo laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what is this fine crop to consist, ma\u2019am?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBoys. I want to open a school for little lads\u2014a good, happy, homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a truly Joian plan for you! Isn\u2019t that just like her?\u201d cried Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like it,\u201d said Mrs. March decidedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be an immense care for Jo,\u201d said Meg, stroking the head of her one all-absorbing son.\r\n\r\n\u201cJo can do it, and be happy in it. It\u2019s a splendid idea. Tell us all about it,\u201d cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d stand by me, sir. Amy does too\u2014I see it in her eyes, though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks. Now, my dear people,\u201d continued Jo earnestly, \u201cjust understand that this isn\u2019t a new idea of mine, but a long cherished plan. Before my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I\u2019d made my fortune, and no one needed me at home, I\u2019d hire a big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn little lads who hadn\u2019t any mothers, and take care of them, and make life jolly for them before it was too late. I see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right minute, I love so to do anything for them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not seen for a long while.\r\n\r\n\u201cI told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would like, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his dear heart, he\u2019s been doing it all his life\u2014helping poor boys, I mean, not getting rich, that he\u2019ll never be. Money doesn\u2019t stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any. But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved me better than I ever deserved, I\u2019m rich, at least I feel so, and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school. It\u2019s just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain. There\u2019s plenty of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard. Such work is healthy, isn\u2019t it, sir? Then Fritz could train and teach in his own way, and Father will help him. I can feed and nurse and pet and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by. I\u2019ve always longed for lots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my heart\u2019s content. Think what luxury\u2014 Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought he\u2019d have an apoplectic fit.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything funny,\u201d she said gravely, when she could be heard. \u201cNothing could be more natural and proper than for my Professor to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is putting on airs already,\u201d said Laurie, who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke. \u201cBut may I inquire how you intend to support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins, I\u2019m afraid your crop won\u2019t be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs. Bhaer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich pupils, also\u2014perhaps begin with such altogether. Then, when I\u2019ve got a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich people\u2019s children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I\u2019ve seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones pushed forward, when it\u2019s real cruelty. Some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that\u2019s the very time they need most patience and kindness. People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men. They don\u2019t complain much\u2014plucky little souls\u2014but they feel it. I\u2019ve been through something of it, and I know all about it. I\u2019ve a special interest in such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest, well-meaning boys\u2019 hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads. I\u2019ve had experience, too, for haven\u2019t I brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll testify that you tried to do it,\u201d said Laurie with a grateful look.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady, sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times. I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone feels it, though you won\u2019t let them say so. Yes, and when I have my flock, I\u2019ll just point to you, and say \u2018There\u2019s your model, my lads\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoor Laurie didn\u2019t know where to look, for, man though he was, something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, Jo, that\u2019s rather too much,\u201d he began, just in his old boyish way. \u201cYou have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for, except by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have rather cast me off lately, Jo, but I\u2019ve had the best of help, nevertheless. So, if I\u2019ve got on at all, you may thank these two for it,\u201d and he laid one hand gently on his grandfather\u2019s head, and the other on Amy\u2019s golden one, for the three were never far apart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world!\u201d burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind just then. \u201cWhen I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as the three I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz were only here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth,\u201d she added more quietly. And that night when she went to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.\r\n\r\nIt was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before she knew where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield. Then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. Laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support. In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.\r\n\r\nOf course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her \u2018wilderness of boys\u2019, and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! There was a sort of poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved, and played cricket in the big field where the irritable \u2018cow with a crumpled horn\u2019 used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort of boys\u2019 paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be called the \u2018Bhaer-garten\u2019, as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be\u2014\u2018a happy, homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness\u2019. Every room in the big house was soon full. Every little plot in the garden soon had its owner. A regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet animals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding words, and grateful hearts, full of love for \u2018Mother Bhaer\u2019. She had boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels, by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin much trouble and anxiety. But her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven. Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or touching little confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more. There were slow boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys, boys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was welcome to the \u2018Bhaer-garten\u2019, though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school.\r\n\r\nYes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much anxiety, and a perpetual racket. She enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers. As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to increase her happiness\u2014Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa\u2019s sunshiny temper as well as his mother\u2019s lively spirit. How they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough nurses loved and served them well.\r\n\r\nThere were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most delightful was the yearly apple-picking. For then the Marches, Laurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it. Five years after Jo\u2019s wedding, one of these fruitful festivals occurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire. Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast. Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting. Birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake. Everybody was there. Everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled down. Everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...\r\n\r\nThe gentle apple\u2019s winey juice.\r\n\r\nThe Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself to the little ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among the bird\u2019s nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck. Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas, sorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups, and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him.\r\n\r\nJo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up. Little Teddy bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small shoes. She knew that little Ted would turn up again in time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.\r\n\r\nAt four o\u2019clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises. Then Jo and Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day. The land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of refreshment as they liked\u2014freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul. They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among the edibles at his own sweet will.\r\n\r\nWhen no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first regular toast, which was always drunk at such times\u2014\u201cAunt March, God bless her!\u201d A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been taught to keep her memory green.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Grandma\u2019s sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with three times three!\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was given with a will, as you may well believe, and the cheering once begun, it was hard to stop it. Everybody\u2019s health was proposed, from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master. Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny presents, some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to Grandma\u2019s\u2014for the children\u2019s gifts were all their own. Every stitch Daisy\u2019s patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March. Demi\u2019s miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn\u2019t shut, Rob\u2019s footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was soothing, and no page of the costly book Amy\u2019s child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words\u2014\u201cTo dear Grandma, from her little Beth.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared, and when Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing. Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best effect. This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand success, for Mrs. March couldn\u2019t get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival tree.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever ought to call myself \u2018unlucky Jo\u2019 again, when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,\u201d said Mrs. Bhaer, taking Teddy\u2019s little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which he was rapturously churning.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago. Do you remember our castles in the air?\u201d asked Amy, smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day,\u201d answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind. \u201cYes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish, lonely, and cold to me now. I haven\u2019t given up the hope that I may write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I\u2019m sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these,\u201d and Jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the Professor\u2019s arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in her lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for splendid things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these. I\u2019ve got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world,\u201d and Meg laid her hand on her tall boy\u2019s head, with a face full of tender and devout content.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter it, though, like Jo, I don\u2019t relinquish all my artistic hopes, or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty. I\u2019ve begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. I think so, myself, and mean to do it in marble, so that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little angel.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy\u2019s sunshine. This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy\u2019s nature was growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender. Laurie was growing more serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blessed for ...\r\n\r\nInto each life some rain must fall,\r\nSome days must be dark and sad and dreary.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear. Don\u2019t despond, but hope and keep happy,\u201d said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted Daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin\u2019s pale one.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie to take more than half of every burden,\u201d replied Amy warmly. \u201cHe never lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can\u2019t love him enough. So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg, \u2018Thank God, I\u2019m a happy woman.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that I\u2019m far happier than I deserve,\u201d added Jo, glancing from her good husband to her chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her. \u201cFritz is getting gray and stout. I\u2019m growing as thin as a shadow, and am thirty. We never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night, for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under the bed-clothes, though he\u2019s set himself afire three times already. But in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of, and never was so jolly in my life. Excuse the remark, but living among boys, I can\u2019t help using their expressions now and then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,\u201d began Mrs. March, frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot half so good as yours, Mother. Here it is, and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done,\u201d cried Jo, with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year,\u201d said Amy softly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA large sheaf, but I know there\u2019s room in your heart for it, Marmee dear,\u201d added Meg\u2019s tender voice.\r\n\r\nTouched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility...\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this!\u201d\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LITTLE WOMEN ***\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Home Again\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nFolklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal. The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\r\n\r\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as \u201chistorical\u201d in the children\u2019s library; for the time has come for a series of newer \u201cwonder tales\u201d in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\r\n\r\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d was written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\r\n\r\nL. Frank Baum\r\nChicago, April, 1900.\r\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\r\nChapter I\r\nThe Cyclone\r\n\r\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer\u2019s wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar\u2014except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\r\n\r\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child\u2019s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy\u2019s merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.\r\n\r\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\r\n\r\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\r\n\r\nToday, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\r\n\r\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cyclone coming, Em,\u201d he called to his wife. \u201cI\u2019ll go look after the stock.\u201d Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.\r\n\r\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of the danger close at hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, Dorothy!\u201d she screamed. \u201cRun for the cellar!\u201d\r\n\r\nToto jumped out of Dorothy\u2019s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThen a strange thing happened.\r\n\r\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\r\n\r\nThe north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.\r\n\r\nIt was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.\r\n\r\nToto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen.\r\n\r\nOnce Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.\r\n\r\nHour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.\r\nChapter II\r\nThe Council with the Munchkins\r\n\r\nShe was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.\r\n\r\nThe little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone had set the house down very gently\u2014for a cyclone\u2014in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.\r\n\r\nWhile she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.\r\n\r\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men were blue; the little woman\u2019s hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.\r\n\r\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life.\r\n\r\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation, \u201cYou are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour house did, anyway,\u201d replied the little old woman, with a laugh, \u201cand that is the same thing. See!\u201d she continued, pointing to the corner of the house. \u201cThere are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear! Oh, dear!\u201d cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay. \u201cThe house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing to be done,\u201d said the little woman calmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who was she?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\u201d answered the little woman. \u201cShe has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are the Munchkins?\u201d inquired Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you a Munchkin?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North. When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, gracious!\u201d cried Dorothy. \u201cAre you a real witch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d answered the little woman. \u201cBut I am a good witch, and the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I thought all witches were wicked,\u201d said the girl, who was half frightened at facing a real witch. \u201cOh, no, that is a great mistake. There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz\u2014the one who lives in the West.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Dorothy, after a moment\u2019s thought, \u201cAunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead\u2014years and years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is Aunt Em?\u201d inquired the little old woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, \u201cI do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d replied Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are the wizards?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOz himself is the Great Wizard,\u201d answered the Witch, sinking her voice to a whisper. \u201cHe is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He lives in the City of Emeralds.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was so old,\u201d explained the Witch of the North, \u201cthat she dried up quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear.\u201d She reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,\u201d said one of the Munchkins, \u201cand there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me. Can you help me find my way?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the East, not far from here,\u201d said one, \u201cthere is a great desert, and none could live to cross it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the same at the South,\u201d said another, \u201cfor I have been there and seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am told,\u201d said the third man, \u201cthat it is the same at the West. And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe North is my home,\u201d said the old lady, \u201cand at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I\u2019m afraid, my dear, you will have to live with us.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted \u201cOne, two, three\u201d in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:\r\n\r\n\u201cLET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on it, asked, \u201cIs your name Dorothy, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is this city?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he a good man?\u201d inquired the girl anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I get there?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you go with me?\u201d pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I cannot do that,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cso you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in just that way, and was not surprised in the least.\r\nChapter III\r\nHow Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter. She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water. Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.\r\n\r\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds.\r\n\r\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\u201d she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if they will fit me,\u201d she said to Toto. \u201cThey would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\r\n\r\nFinally she picked up her basket.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome along, Toto,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will go to the Emerald City and ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.\r\n\r\nThere were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land.\r\n\r\nShe was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color.\r\n\r\nToward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.\r\n\r\nThe people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.\r\n\r\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.\r\n\r\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \u201cYou must be a great sorceress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch. Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wear white.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dress is blue and white checked,\u201d said Dorothy, smoothing out the wrinkles in it.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is kind of you to wear that,\u201d said Boq. \u201cBlue is the color of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly witch.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.\r\n\r\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house, where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.\r\n\r\nShe ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a dog before.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow far is it to the Emerald City?\u201d the girl asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d answered Boq gravely, \u201cfor I have never been there. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back.\r\n\r\nShe bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.\r\n\r\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back.\r\n\r\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood day,\u201d said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you speak?\u201d asked the girl, in wonder.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d answered the Scarecrow. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty well, thank you,\u201d replied Dorothy politely. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not feeling well,\u201d said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \u201cfor it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you get down?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for, being stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on the ground. \u201cI feel like a new man.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned. \u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Dorothy,\u201d said the girl, \u201cand I am going to the Emerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is the Emerald City?\u201d he inquired. \u201cAnd who is Oz?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, don\u2019t you know?\u201d she returned, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed. I don\u2019t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no brains at all,\u201d he answered sadly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cI\u2019m awfully sorry for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think,\u201d he asked, \u201cif I go to the Emerald City with you, that Oz would give me some brains?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell,\u201d she returned, \u201cbut you may come with me, if you like. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said the Scarecrow. \u201cYou see,\u201d he continued confidentially, \u201cI don\u2019t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed, because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me, it doesn\u2019t matter, for I can\u2019t feel it. But I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand how you feel,\u201d said the little girl, who was truly sorry for him. \u201cIf you will come with me I\u2019ll ask Oz to do all he can for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he answered gratefully.\r\n\r\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\r\n\r\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Toto,\u201d said Dorothy to her new friend. \u201cHe never bites.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d replied the Scarecrow. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt the straw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can\u2019t get tired. I\u2019ll tell you a secret,\u201d he continued, as he walked along. \u201cThere is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Dorothy; \u201cthe Munchkin farmer who made you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d answered the Scarecrow; \u201cit\u2019s a lighted match.\u201d\r\nChapter IV\r\nThe Road Through the Forest\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks, which were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap.\r\n\r\nThe farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back. There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.\r\n\r\nAt noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he refused.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am never hungry,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is a lucky thing I am not, for my mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the shape of my head.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on eating her bread.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me something about yourself and the country you came from,\u201d said the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer Land of Oz.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, \u201cI cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is because you have no brains\u201d answered the girl. \u201cNo matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful. There is no place like home.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I cannot understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you tell me a story, while we are resting?\u201d asked the child.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was only made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what was going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying, \u2018How do you like those ears?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018They aren\u2019t straight,\u2019\u201d answered the other.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never mind,\u2019\u201d said the farmer. \u201c\u2018They are ears just the same,\u2019\u201d which was true enough.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Now I\u2019ll make the eyes,\u2019\u201d said the farmer. So he painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my first glimpse of the world.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s a rather pretty eye,\u2019\u201d remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer. \u201c\u2018Blue paint is just the color for eyes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I think I\u2019ll make the other a little bigger,\u2019\u201d said the farmer. And when the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time I didn\u2019t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,\u2019 said the farmer. \u2018He looks just like a man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, he is a man,\u2019 said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a tall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them. But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on that pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of, having been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.\u2019 Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, \u2018If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a better man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try hard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d said Dorothy earnestly, \u201csince you seem anxious to have them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; I am anxious,\u201d returned the Scarecrow. \u201cIt is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the girl, \u201clet us go.\u201d And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThere were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough and untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and went on into the forest.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf this road goes in, it must come out,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cand as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever it leads us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyone would know that,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly; that is why I know it,\u201d returned the Scarecrow. \u201cIf it required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,\u201d she said, \u201cyou must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\nSoon after the Scarecrow stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see a little cottage at the right of us,\u201d he said, \u201cbuilt of logs and branches. Shall we go there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d answered the child. \u201cI am all tired out.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came.\r\nChapter V\r\nThe Rescue of the Tin Woodman\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and looked around her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his corner, waiting for her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must go and search for water,\u201d she said to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you want water?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the dry bread will not stick in my throat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,\u201d said the Scarecrow thoughtfully, \u201cfor you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked timidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine,\u201d replied the Scarecrow; \u201cbut we can go and see.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of surprise.\r\n\r\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.\r\n\r\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his teeth.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you groan?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered the tin man, \u201cI did. I\u2019ve been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet an oil-can and oil my joints,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she returned and asked anxiously, \u201cWhere are your joints?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOil my neck, first,\u201d replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow oil the joints in my arms,\u201d he said. And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which he leaned against the tree.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a great comfort,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted, and I\u2019m glad to be able to put it down at last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right once more.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite creature, and very grateful.\r\n\r\n\u201cI might have stood there always if you had not come along,\u201d he said; \u201cso you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,\u201d she answered, \u201cand we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you wish to see Oz?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you suppose Oz could give me a heart?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I guess so,\u201d Dorothy answered. \u201cIt would be as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d the Tin Woodman returned. \u201cSo, if you will allow me to join your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome along,\u201d said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket. \u201cFor,\u201d he said, \u201cif I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I would need the oil-can badly.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.\r\n\r\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you walk around the hole?\u201d asked the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough,\u201d replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. \u201cMy head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \u201cBut, after all, brains are not the best things in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you any?\u201d inquired the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my head is quite empty,\u201d answered the Woodman. \u201cBut once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much rather have a heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you my story, and then you will know.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the following story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger\u2014that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cI shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall take the heart,\u201d returned the Tin Woodman; \u201cfor brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.\r\n\r\nWhat worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.\r\nChapter VI\r\nThe Cowardly Lion\r\n\r\nAll this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good.\r\n\r\nThere were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made the little girl\u2019s heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy\u2019s side, and did not even bark in return.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long will it be,\u201d the child asked of the Tin Woodman, \u201cbefore we are out of the forest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell,\u201d was the answer, \u201cfor I have never been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch\u2019s kiss, and that will protect you from harm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Toto!\u201d said the girl anxiously. \u201cWhat will protect him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,\u201d replied the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But, to the Lion\u2019s surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\r\n\r\nLittle Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bite him,\u201d said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but you tried to,\u201d she retorted. \u201cYou are nothing but a big coward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it,\u201d said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. \u201cI\u2019ve always known it. But how can I help it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like the poor Scarecrow!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he stuffed?\u201d asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shape again.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s stuffed,\u201d replied Dorothy, who was still angry.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he went over so easily,\u201d remarked the Lion. \u201cIt astonished me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201che\u2019s made of tin.\u201d And she helped the Woodman up again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he nearly blunted my claws,\u201d said the Lion. \u201cWhen they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What is that little animal you are so tender of?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is my dog, Toto,\u201d answered Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he made of tin, or stuffed?\u201d asked the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither. He\u2019s a\u2014a\u2014a meat dog,\u201d said the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! He\u2019s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me,\u201d continued the Lion sadly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes you a coward?\u201d asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery,\u201d replied the Lion. \u201cI suppose I was born that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way. Whenever I\u2019ve met a man I\u2019ve been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself\u2014I\u2019m such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that isn\u2019t right. The King of Beasts shouldn\u2019t be a coward,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it,\u201d returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. \u201cIt is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy. But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you have heart disease,\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be,\u201d said the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you have,\u201d continued the Tin Woodman, \u201cyou ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart disease.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said the Lion thoughtfully, \u201cif I had no heart I should not be a coward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you brains?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose so. I\u2019ve never looked to see,\u201d replied the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,\u201d remarked the Scarecrow, \u201cfor my head is stuffed with straw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am going to ask him to give me a heart,\u201d said the Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,\u201d added Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think Oz could give me courage?\u201d asked the Cowardly Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as easily as he could give me brains,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cOr give me a heart,\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cOr send me back to Kansas,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cfor my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will be very welcome,\u201d answered Dorothy, \u201cfor you will help to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey really are,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy\u2019s side. Toto did not approve of this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion\u2019s great jaws. But after a time he became more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy\u2019s basket and oiled the Woodman\u2019s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis will serve me a lesson,\u201d said he, \u201cto look where I step. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.\u201d\r\n\r\nThereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou people with hearts,\u201d he said, \u201chave something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn\u2019t mind so much.\u201d\r\nChapter VII\r\nThe Journey to the Great Oz\r\n\r\nThey were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you wish,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cI will go into the forest and kill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t! Please don\u2019t,\u201d begged the Tin Woodman. \u201cI should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn\u2019t mention it. And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy\u2019s basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.\r\n\r\nWhen it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.\r\n\r\nThis was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d asked Dorothy despairingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\nBut the Scarecrow said, \u201cWe cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we climb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where we are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I could jump over it,\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring the distance carefully in his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we are all right,\u201d answered the Scarecrow, \u201cfor you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll try it,\u201d said the Lion. \u201cWho will go first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will,\u201d declared the Scarecrow, \u201cfor, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am terribly afraid of falling, myself,\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, \u201cbut I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we will make the attempt.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow sat upon the Lion\u2019s back, and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you run and jump?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause that isn\u2019t the way we Lions do these things,\u201d he replied. Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again.\r\n\r\nDorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on the Lion\u2019s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand. The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.\r\n\r\nThey found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are the Kalidahs?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers,\u201d replied the Lion, \u201cand with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I\u2019m terribly afraid of the Kalidahs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that you are,\u201d returned Dorothy. \u201cThey must be dreadful beasts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not leap across it.\r\n\r\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the Scarecrow said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a first-rate idea,\u201d said the Lion. \u201cOne would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.\r\n\r\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are the Kalidahs!\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick!\u201d cried the Scarecrow. \u201cLet us cross over.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman followed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am alive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute!\u201d called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, \u201cI see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said the Tin Woodman sadly, \u201cI wish I had a heart to beat.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had to ride on the Lion\u2019s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow shall we cross the river?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is easily done,\u201d replied the Scarecrow. \u201cThe Tin Woodman must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.\r\n\r\nBut it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done. So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.\r\nChapter VIII\r\nThe Deadly Poppy Field\r\n\r\nOur little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land. But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.\r\n\r\nThey got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is bad,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \u201cfor if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West, and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then I should get no brains,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I should get no courage,\u201d said the Cowardly Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I should get no heart,\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I should never get back to Kansas,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,\u201d the Scarecrow continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out again\u2014or let go\u2014the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye!\u201d he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave him. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy\u2019s apron.\r\n\r\nOf course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,\u201d he thought. \u201cThen, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never have any brains, after all!\u201d\r\n\r\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind. Then the Lion said:\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman\u2019s long pole and helped push the raft to the land.\r\n\r\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must get back to the road, in some way,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again,\u201d remarked the Lion.\r\n\r\nSo, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.\r\n\r\nThey walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out: \u201cLook!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can we do to save him?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know. So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water\u2019s edge.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you and where are you going?\u201d asked the Stork.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Dorothy,\u201d answered the girl, \u201cand these are my friends, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the road,\u201d said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it,\u201d returned Dorothy, \u201cbut we have lost the Scarecrow, and are wondering how we shall get him again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d asked the Stork.\r\n\r\n\u201cOver there in the river,\u201d answered the little girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t so big and heavy I would get him for you,\u201d remarked the Stork.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t heavy a bit,\u201d said Dorothy eagerly, \u201cfor he is stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever and ever so much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll try,\u201d said the Stork, \u201cbut if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting.\r\n\r\nWhen the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they walked along he sang \u201cTol-de-ri-de-oh!\u201d at every step, he felt so gay.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her some kindness in return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d said the Stork, who was flying along beside them. \u201cI always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight.\r\n\r\nThey walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t they beautiful?\u201d the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d answered the Scarecrow. \u201cWhen I have brains, I shall probably like them better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I only had a heart, I should love them,\u201d added the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI always did like flowers,\u201d said the Lion. \u201cThey seem so helpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,\u201d he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d asked the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we leave her here she will die,\u201d said the Lion. \u201cThe smell of the flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and the dog is asleep already.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent of the flowers.\r\n\r\n\u201cRun fast,\u201d said the Scarecrow to the Lion, \u201cand get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go. In a moment he was out of sight.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us make a chair with our hands and carry her,\u201d said the Scarecrow. So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy\u2019s lap, and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\r\n\r\nOn and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can do nothing for him,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, sadly; \u201cfor he is much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said the Scarecrow. \u201cThe Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.\r\nChapter IX\r\nThe Queen of the Field Mice\r\n\r\n\u201cWe cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,\u201d remarked the Scarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, \u201cfor we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature.\r\n\r\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast\u2019s head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces.\r\n\r\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak of it, I beg of you,\u201d replied the Woodman. \u201cI have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly a mouse!\u201d cried the little animal, indignantly. \u201cWhy, I am a Queen\u2014the Queen of all the Field Mice!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d said the Woodman, making a bow.\r\n\r\n\u201cTherefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in saving my life,\u201d added the Queen.\r\n\r\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat?\u201d They all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis funny tin man,\u201d she answered, \u201ckilled the Wildcat and saved my life. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest wish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will!\u201d cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.\r\n\r\nBut the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight, while he called to the mice, \u201cCome back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, \u201cAre you sure he will not bite us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not let him,\u201d said the Woodman; \u201cso do not be afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again, although he tried to get out of the Woodman\u2019s arms, and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one of the biggest mice spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there anything we can do,\u201d it asked, \u201cto repay you for saving the life of our Queen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing that I know of,\u201d answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed with straw, said, quickly, \u201cOh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA Lion!\u201d cried the little Queen. \u201cWhy, he would eat us all up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d declared the Scarecrow; \u201cthis Lion is a coward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked the Mouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says so himself,\u201d answered the Scarecrow, \u201cand he would never hurt anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all with kindness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the Queen, \u201cwe trust you. But what shall we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to obey you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; there are thousands,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each one bring a long piece of string.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, \u201cyou must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.\r\n\r\nThey came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cPermit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she became quite friendly with the little girl.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed to get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep.\r\n\r\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\r\n\r\nDorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had been rescued.\r\n\r\nThen the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf ever you need us again,\u201d she said, \u201ccome out into the field and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye!\u201d they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.\r\n\r\nAfter this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her dinner.\r\nChapter X\r\nThe Guardian of the Gate\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ran as fast as I could,\u201d he said, sitting down and yawning, \u201cbut the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?\u201d\r\n\r\nThen they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cand then we can keep on to the Emerald City.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.\r\n\r\nThe road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades. Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis must be the Land of Oz,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cand we are surely getting near the Emerald City.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered the Scarecrow. \u201cEverything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I\u2019m afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like something to eat besides fruit,\u201d said the girl, \u201cand I\u2019m sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked.\r\n\r\nA woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, \u201cWhat do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,\u201d answered Dorothy; \u201cand the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he tame?\u201d asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said the girl, \u201cand he is a great coward, too. He will be more afraid of you than you are of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion, \u201cif that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you all going?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the Emerald City,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cto see the Great Oz.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d exclaimed the man. \u201cAre you sure that Oz will see you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes he never go out?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is he like?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is hard to tell,\u201d said the man thoughtfully. \u201cYou see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is very strange,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cbut we must try, in some way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you wish to see the terrible Oz?\u201d asked the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want him to give me some brains,\u201d said the Scarecrow eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Oz could do that easily enough,\u201d declared the man. \u201cHe has more brains than he needs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I want him to give me a heart,\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will not trouble him,\u201d continued the man, \u201cfor Oz has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I want him to give me courage,\u201d said the Cowardly Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cOz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,\u201d said the man, \u201cwhich he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over. He will be glad to give you some.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I want him to send me back to Kansas,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is Kansas?\u201d asked the man, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Dorothy sorrowfully, \u201cbut it is my home, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?\u201d he continued, speaking to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.\r\n\r\nThe woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal. The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.\r\n\r\nThe woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat must be the Emerald City,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\nAs they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.\r\n\r\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\r\n\r\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\r\n\r\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, \u201cWhat do you wish in the Emerald City?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe came here to see the Great Oz,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\u201d he said, shaking his head in perplexity. \u201cHe is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\u201d replied the Scarecrow; \u201cit is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo he is,\u201d said the green man, \u201cand he rules the Emerald City wisely and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the spectacles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\r\n\r\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key.\r\n\r\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.\r\nChapter XI\r\nThe Wonderful City of Oz\r\n\r\nEven with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City. The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.\r\n\r\nThere were many people\u2014men, women, and children\u2014walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them. Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere are strangers,\u201d said the Guardian of the Gates to him, \u201cand they demand to see the Great Oz.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStep inside,\u201d answered the soldier, \u201cand I will carry your message to him.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when they were seated he said politely:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz you are here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at last, he came back, Dorothy asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you seen Oz?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d returned the soldier; \u201cI have never seen him. But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day. Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d replied the girl; \u201cthat is very kind of Oz.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said, \u201cFollow me and I will show you your room.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books. When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\r\n\r\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMake yourself perfectly at home,\u201d said the green girl, \u201cand if you wish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto\u2019s neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz.\r\n\r\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d answered the girl, \u201cif he will see me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he will see you,\u201d said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard, \u201calthough he does not like to have people ask to see him. Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \u201cThat is the signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner.\r\n\r\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\r\n\r\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard a voice say:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head; so she took courage and answered:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you get the silver shoes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on her and killed her,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you get the mark upon your forehead?\u201d continued the voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you,\u201d said the girl.\r\n\r\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the truth. Then Oz asked, \u201cWhat do you wish me to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSend me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\u201d she answered earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t like your country, although it is so beautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should I do this for you?\u201d asked Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a little girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\u201d said Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat just happened,\u201d returned Dorothy simply; \u201cI could not help it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Head, \u201cI will give you my answer. You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first. Help me and I will help you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat must I do?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cKill the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d answered Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I cannot!\u201d exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas\u2014but not before.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz felt that she could help him if she would.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never killed anything, willingly,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cEven if I wanted to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d said the Head; \u201cbut that is my answer, and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember that the Witch is Wicked\u2014tremendously Wicked\u2014and ought to be killed. Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\u201d\r\n\r\nSorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her. \u201cThere is no hope for me,\u201d she said sadly, \u201cfor Oz will not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and that I can never do.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome with me, for Oz has sent for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady. She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings, gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\u201d\r\n\r\nNow the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains, and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should I do this for you?\u201d asked the Lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,\u201d answered the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never grant favors without some return,\u201d said Oz; \u201cbut this much I will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,\u201d said the Scarecrow, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I did. I don\u2019t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cshe needs a heart as much as the Tin Woodman.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOz has sent for you. Follow me.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he hoped it would be the lovely Lady. \u201cFor,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cif it is the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast. It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much disappointed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\u201d spoke the Beast, in a voice that was one great roar. \u201cWho are you, and why do you seek me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot love. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should I do this?\u201d demanded the Beast.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,\u201d answered the Woodman.\r\n\r\nOz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: \u201cIf you indeed desire a heart, you must earn it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked the Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHelp Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d replied the Beast. \u201cWhen the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the Lion said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so frighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my bidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be well.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.\r\n\r\nThe Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.\r\n\r\nThen a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the words it spoke:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd the Lion answered, \u201cI am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts, as men call me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should I give you courage?\u201d demanded Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to grant my request,\u201d answered the Lion.\r\n\r\nThe Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, \u201cBring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you courage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d asked Dorothy sadly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is only one thing we can do,\u201d returned the Lion, \u201cand that is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut suppose we cannot?\u201d said the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall never have courage,\u201d declared the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I shall never have brains,\u201d added the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I shall never have a heart,\u201d spoke the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,\u201d said Dorothy, beginning to cry.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe careful!\u201d cried the green girl. \u201cThe tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy dried her eyes and said, \u201cI suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will go with you; but I\u2019m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,\u201d said the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will go too,\u201d declared the Scarecrow; \u201cbut I shall not be of much help to you, I am such a fool.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the heart to harm even a Witch,\u201d remarked the Tin Woodman; \u201cbut if you go I certainly shall go with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nTherefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy\u2019s basket with good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto\u2019s neck with a green ribbon.\r\n\r\nThey went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg.\r\nChapter XII\r\nThe Search for the Wicked Witch\r\n\r\nThe soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no road,\u201d answered the Guardian of the Gates. \u201cNo one ever wishes to go that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, then, are we to find her?\u201d inquired the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will be easy,\u201d replied the man, \u201cfor when she knows you are in the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her slaves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cfor we mean to destroy her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that is different,\u201d said the Guardian of the Gates. \u201cNo one has ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West, walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer green, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto\u2019s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy\u2019s dress.\r\n\r\nThe Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West, and the ground was untilled.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.\r\n\r\nNow the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.\r\n\r\nAt once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to those people,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cand tear them to pieces.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you not going to make them your slaves?\u201d asked the leader of the wolves.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, \u201cone is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into small pieces.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed by the others.\r\n\r\nIt was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is my fight,\u201d said the Woodman, \u201cso get behind me and I will meet them as they come.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf\u2019s head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman\u2019s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman.\r\n\r\nThen he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, \u201cIt was a good fight, friend.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.\r\n\r\nNow this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her country. This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver whistle twice.\r\n\r\nStraightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough to darken the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, \u201cFly at once to the strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.\r\n\r\nBut the Scarecrow said, \u201cThis is my battle, so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up and stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare to come any nearer. But the King Crow said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead beside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they went upon their journey.\r\n\r\nWhen the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her silver whistle.\r\n\r\nForthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to the strangers and sting them to death!\u201d commanded the Witch, and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the Scarecrow had decided what to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the Lion,\u201d he said to the Woodman, \u201cand the bees cannot sting them.\u201d This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.\r\n\r\nThe bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting the Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.\r\n\r\nThen Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as ever. So they started upon their journey once more.\r\n\r\nThe Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them.\r\n\r\nThe Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to think what she should do next. She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to act.\r\n\r\nThere was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given. But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.\r\n\r\nSo the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:\r\n\r\n\u201cEp-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!\u201d\r\n\r\nNext she stood upon her right foot and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cZiz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\u201d\r\n\r\nNow the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nOne, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew close to the Witch and said, \u201cYou have called us for the third and last time. What do you command?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion,\u201d said the Wicked Witch. \u201cBring that beast to me, for I have a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour commands shall be obeyed,\u201d said the leader. Then, with a great deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy and her friends were walking.\r\n\r\nSome of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks. Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan.\r\n\r\nOthers of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree.\r\n\r\nThe remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the Witch\u2019s castle, where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not escape.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms, watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the mark of the Good Witch\u2019s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short, motioning the others not to touch her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe dare not harm this little girl,\u201d he said to them, \u201cfor she is protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of Evil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her there.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they set her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the Witch:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on Dorothy\u2019s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked down at Dorothy\u2019s feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened to look into the child\u2019s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and thought, \u201cI can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to use her power.\u201d Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\r\n\r\nDorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her.\r\n\r\nWith Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I cannot harness you,\u201d said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through the bars of the gate, \u201cI can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked, \u201cAre you ready to be harnessed like a horse?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd the Lion would answer, \u201cNo. If you come in this yard, I will bite you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw, and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.\r\n\r\nThe girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.\r\n\r\nDorothy\u2019s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.\r\n\r\nNow the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothy\u2019s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let water touch her in any way.\r\n\r\nBut the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at full length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot.\r\n\r\nThe wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how to do so.\r\n\r\nThe little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, and said to the Witch, \u201cGive me back my shoe!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not,\u201d retorted the Witch, \u201cfor it is now my shoe, and not yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are a wicked creature!\u201d cried Dorothy. \u201cYou have no right to take my shoe from me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall keep it, just the same,\u201d said the Witch, laughing at her, \u201cand someday I shall get the other one from you, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot.\r\n\r\nInstantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee what you have done!\u201d she screamed. \u201cIn a minute I shall melt away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, indeed,\u201d said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know water would be the end of me?\u201d asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d answered Dorothy. \u201cHow should I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds. Look out\u2014here I go!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land.\r\nChapter XIII\r\nThe Rescue\r\n\r\nThe Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free. They went in together to the castle, where Dorothy\u2019s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves.\r\n\r\nThere was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and dancing.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cI should be quite happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you suppose we could rescue them?\u201d asked the girl anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can try,\u201d answered the Lion.\r\n\r\nSo they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short.\r\n\r\nThe Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry. When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:\r\n\r\n\u201cAre any of your people tinsmiths?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,\u201d they told her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen bring them to me,\u201d she said. And when the tinsmiths came, bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, \u201cCan you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.\r\n\r\nWhen, at last, he walked into Dorothy\u2019s room and thanked her for rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his joints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we only had the Scarecrow with us again,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, \u201cI should be quite happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must try to find him,\u201d said the girl.\r\n\r\nSo she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\nIt was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it; but the Woodman said at once, \u201cI\u2019ll chop it down, and then we can get the Scarecrow\u2019s clothes.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself, another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman\u2019s axe, instead of the old broken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow\u2019s clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.\r\n\r\nDorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold! here was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him.\r\n\r\nNow that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable.\r\n\r\nBut one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, \u201cWe must go back to Oz, and claim his promise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Woodman, \u201cat last I shall get my heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I shall get my brains,\u201d added the Scarecrow joyfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I shall get my courage,\u201d said the Lion thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I shall get back to Kansas,\u201d cried Dorothy, clapping her hands. \u201cOh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together and bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return, and all shook hands with them until their arms ached.\r\n\r\nDorothy went to the Witch\u2019s cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.\r\n\r\nThen, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald City; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them.\r\nChapter XIV\r\nThe Winged Monkeys\r\n\r\nYou will remember there was no road\u2014not even a pathway\u2014between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning\u2014all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if they were quite sure which way they were going.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we walk far enough,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cI am sure we shall sometime come to some place.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have surely lost our way,\u201d he said, \u201cand unless we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I my heart,\u201d declared the Tin Woodman. \u201cIt seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, \u201cI haven\u2019t the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose we call the field mice,\u201d she suggested. \u201cThey could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure they could,\u201d cried the Scarecrow. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we think of that before?\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her squeaky little voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for my friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have lost our way,\u201d said Dorothy. \u201cCan you tell us where the Emerald City is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d answered the Queen; \u201cbut it is a great way off, for you have had it at your backs all this time.\u201d Then she noticed Dorothy\u2019s Golden Cap, and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use the charm of the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a charm,\u201d answered Dorothy, in surprise. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is written inside the Golden Cap,\u201d replied the Queen of the Mice. \u201cBut if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t they hurt me?\u201d asked the girl anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!\u201d And she scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.\r\n\r\nDorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cEp-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!\u201d she said, standing on her left foot.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was doing.\r\n\r\n\u201cHil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\u201d Dorothy went on, standing this time on her right foot.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d replied the Tin Woodman calmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cZiz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\u201d said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.\r\n\r\nThe King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, \u201cWhat is your command?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe wish to go to the Emerald City,\u201d said the child, \u201cand we have lost our way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will carry you,\u201d replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her. Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them.\r\n\r\nDorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a long story,\u201d answered the King, with a winged laugh; \u201cbut as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be glad to hear it,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce,\u201d began the leader, \u201cwe were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelette\u2019s palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Swim out, my fine fellow,\u2019 cried my grandfather, \u2018and see if the water has spotted your clothes.\u2019 Quelala was much too wise not to swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore. But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what became of them?\u201d asked Dorothy, who had been greatly interested in the story.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,\u201d replied the Monkey, \u201che was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was a good ride,\u201d said the little girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and a quick way out of our troubles,\u201d replied the Lion. \u201cHow lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!\u201d\r\nChapter XV\r\nThe Discovery of Oz, the Terrible\r\n\r\nThe four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! are you back again?\u201d he asked, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not see us?\u201d answered the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe did visit her,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she let you go again?\u201d asked the man, in wonder.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe could not help it, for she is melted,\u201d explained the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cMelted! Well, that is good news, indeed,\u201d said the man. \u201cWho melted her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was Dorothy,\u201d said the Lion gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood gracious!\u201d exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before her.\r\n\r\nThen he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.\r\n\r\nThe soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.\r\n\r\nThe soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not. When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o\u2019clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.\r\n\r\nThe four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again.\r\n\r\nPromptly at nine o\u2019clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz.\r\n\r\nOf course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.\r\n\r\nPresently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome, and it said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, Dorothy asked, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am everywhere,\u201d answered the Voice, \u201cbut to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me.\u201d Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have come to claim our promise, O Oz.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat promise?\u201d asked Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroyed,\u201d said the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you promised to give me brains,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you promised to give me a heart,\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you promised to give me courage,\u201d said the Cowardly Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the Wicked Witch really destroyed?\u201d asked the Voice, and Dorothy thought it trembled a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, \u201cI melted her with a bucket of water.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me,\u201d said the Voice, \u201chow sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for I must have time to think it over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had plenty of time already,\u201d said the Tin Woodman angrily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shan\u2019t wait a day longer,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must keep your promises to us!\u201d exclaimed Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThe Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were. The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and cried out, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\u201d said the little man, in a trembling voice. \u201cBut don\u2019t strike me\u2014please don\u2019t\u2014and I\u2019ll do anything you want me to.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought Oz was a great Head,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,\u201d exclaimed the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you are all wrong,\u201d said the little man meekly. \u201cI have been making believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaking believe!\u201d cried Dorothy. \u201cAre you not a Great Wizard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, my dear,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t speak so loud, or you will be overheard\u2014and I should be ruined. I\u2019m supposed to be a Great Wizard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it, my dear; I\u2019m just a common man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re more than that,\u201d said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \u201cyou\u2019re a humbug.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly so!\u201d declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him. \u201cI am a humbug.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this is terrible,\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \u201cHow shall I ever get my heart?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr I my courage?\u201d asked the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cOr I my brains?\u201d wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear friends,\u201d said Oz, \u201cI pray you not to speak of these little things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I\u2019m in at being found out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone else know you\u2019re a humbug?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one knows it but you four\u2014and myself,\u201d replied Oz. \u201cI have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \u201cHow was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was one of my tricks,\u201d answered Oz. \u201cStep this way, please, and I will tell you all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted face.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\u201d said Oz. \u201cI stood behind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how about the voice?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I am a ventriloquist,\u201d said the little man. \u201cI can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of the Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.\u201d He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their sides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cyou ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am\u2014I certainly am,\u201d answered the little man sorrowfully; \u201cbut it was the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was born in Omaha\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that isn\u2019t very far from Kansas!\u201d cried Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but it\u2019s farther from here,\u201d he said, shaking his head at her sadly. \u201cWhen I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast.\u201d Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was. \u201cAfter a time,\u201d continued Oz, \u201cI tired of that, and became a balloonist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cA man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus,\u201d he explained.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so that I couldn\u2019t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles away. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds, thought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well. Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t everything here green?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more than in any other city,\u201d replied Oz; \u201cbut when you wear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do wonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West. Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East. When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you are a very bad man,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, my dear; I\u2019m really a very good man, but I\u2019m a very bad Wizard, I must admit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you give me brains?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has brains, but it doesn\u2019t know much. Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat may all be true,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cbut I shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019m not much of a magician, as I said; but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head with brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find that out for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thank you\u2014thank you!\u201d cried the Scarecrow. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to use them, never fear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how about my courage?\u201d asked the Lion anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have plenty of courage, I am sure,\u201d answered Oz. \u201cAll you need is confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I have, but I\u2019m scared just the same,\u201d said the Lion. \u201cI shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,\u201d replied Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about my heart?\u201d asked the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, as for that,\u201d answered Oz, \u201cI think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat must be a matter of opinion,\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \u201cFor my part, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me the heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d answered Oz meekly. \u201cCome to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continue the part a little longer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201chow am I to get back to Kansas?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall have to think about that,\u201d replied the little man. \u201cGive me two or three days to consider the matter and I\u2019ll try to find a way to carry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in return for my help\u2014such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a humbug.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to their rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that \u201cThe Great and Terrible Humbug,\u201d as she called him, would find a way to send her back to Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.\r\nChapter XVI\r\nThe Magic Art of the Great Humbug\r\n\r\nNext morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:\r\n\r\n\u201cCongratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I return I shall be as other men are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have always liked you as you were,\u201d said Dorothy simply.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out.\u201d Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said Oz.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window, engaged in deep thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come for my brains,\u201d remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,\u201d replied Oz. \u201cYou must excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d said the Scarecrow. \u201cYou are quite welcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow\u2019s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.\r\n\r\nWhen he had fastened the Scarecrow\u2019s head on his body again he said to him, \u201cHereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends.\r\n\r\nDorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the top with brains.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel wise indeed,\u201d he answered earnestly. \u201cWhen I get used to my brains I shall know everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?\u201d asked the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is proof that he is sharp,\u201d remarked the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I must go to Oz and get my heart,\u201d said the Woodman. So he walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, \u201cI have come for my heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d answered the little man. \u201cBut I shall have to cut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d answered the Woodman. \u201cI shall not feel it at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Oz brought a pair of tinsmith\u2019s shears and cut a small, square hole in the left side of the Tin Woodman\u2019s breast. Then, going to a chest of drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a beauty?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, indeed!\u201d replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. \u201cBut is it a kind heart?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, very!\u201d answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman\u2019s breast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it had been cut.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said he; \u201cnow you have a heart that any man might be proud of. I\u2019m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind the patch,\u201d exclaimed the happy Woodman. \u201cI am very grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak of it,\u201d replied Oz.\r\n\r\nThen the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune.\r\n\r\nThe Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come for my courage,\u201d announced the Lion, entering the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d answered the little man; \u201cI will get it for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:\r\n\r\n\u201cDrink.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d answered Oz, \u201cif it were inside of you, it would be courage. You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d asked Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cFull of courage,\u201d replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune.\r\n\r\nOz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. \u201cHow can I help being a humbug,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen all these people make me do things that everybody knows can\u2019t be done? It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything. But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know how it can be done.\u201d\r\nChapter XVII\r\nHow the Balloon Was Launched\r\n\r\nFor three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs.\r\n\r\nThus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd back to Kansas?\u201d she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure about Kansas,\u201d said Oz, \u201cfor I haven\u2019t the faintest notion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I cross the desert?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what I think,\u201d said the little man. \u201cYou see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone; but I\u2019ve been thinking the matter over, and I believe I can make a balloon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cA balloon,\u201d said Oz, \u201cis made of silk, which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be no trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with, to make it float.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it won\u2019t float,\u201d remarked Dorothy, \u201cit will be of no use to us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d answered Oz. \u201cBut there is another way to make it float, which is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn\u2019t as good as gas, for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we should be lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe!\u201d exclaimed the girl. \u201cAre you going with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d replied Oz. \u201cI am tired of being such a humbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them. So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome. I\u2019d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be glad to have your company,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he answered. \u201cNow, if you will help me sew the silk together, we will begin to work on our balloon.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long.\r\n\r\nThen Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we must have a basket to ride in,\u201d he said. So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight.\r\n\r\nOz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the ground.\r\n\r\nThen Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow will rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, Dorothy!\u201d cried the Wizard. \u201cHurry up, or the balloon will fly away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t find Toto anywhere,\u201d replied Dorothy, who did not wish to leave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran towards the balloon.\r\n\r\nShe was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air without her.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome back!\u201d she screamed. \u201cI want to go, too!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t come back, my dear,\u201d called Oz from the basket. \u201cGood-bye!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye!\u201d shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and farther into the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, though he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know. But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:\r\n\r\n\u201cOz was always our friend. When he was here he built for us this beautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us.\u201d\r\n\r\nStill, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard, and would not be comforted.\r\nChapter XVIII\r\nAway to the South\r\n\r\nDorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon. And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her companions.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman came to her and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTruly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone, if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can, to guard against mishap.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he was not a Wizard the people were proud of him. \u201cFor,\u201d they said, \u201cthere is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.\u201d And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are not so unlucky,\u201d said the new ruler, \u201cfor this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer\u2019s cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quite satisfied with my lot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI also,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \u201cam well-pleased with my new heart; and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived, if not braver,\u201d said the Lion modestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,\u201d continued the Scarecrow, \u201cwe might all be happy together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to live here,\u201d cried Dorothy. \u201cI want to go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what can be done?\u201d inquired the Woodman.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the desert?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never thought of that!\u201d said Dorothy joyfully. \u201cIt\u2019s just the thing. I\u2019ll go at once for the Golden Cap.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the second time you have called us,\u201d said the Monkey King, bowing before the little girl. \u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you to fly with me to Kansas,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat cannot be done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe belong to this country alone, and cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet, and I suppose there never will be, for they don\u2019t belong there. We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross the desert. Good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window, followed by all his band.\r\n\r\nDorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. \u201cI have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose,\u201d she said, \u201cfor the Winged Monkeys cannot help me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is certainly too bad!\u201d said the tender-hearted Woodman.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,\u201d he said, \u201cand ask his advice.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis little girl,\u201d said the Scarecrow to the soldier, \u201cwishes to cross the desert. How can she do so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell,\u201d answered the soldier, \u201cfor nobody has ever crossed the desert, unless it is Oz himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there no one who can help me?\u201d asked Dorothy earnestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cGlinda might,\u201d he suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is Glinda?\u201d inquired the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches, and rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of the desert, so she may know a way to cross it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGlinda is a Good Witch, isn\u2019t she?\u201d asked the child.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Quadlings think she is good,\u201d said the soldier, \u201cand she is kind to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I get to her castle?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe road is straight to the South,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut it is said to be full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must have been thinking again,\u201d remarked the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall go with Dorothy,\u201d declared the Lion, \u201cfor I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d agreed the Woodman. \u201cMy axe may be of service to her; so I also will go with her to the Land of the South.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen shall we start?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going?\u201d they asked, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. If it wasn\u2019t for Dorothy I should never have had brains. She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Dorothy gratefully. \u201cYou are all very kind to me. But I should like to start as soon as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall go tomorrow morning,\u201d returned the Scarecrow. \u201cSo now let us all get ready, for it will be a long journey.\u201d\r\nChapter XIX\r\nAttacked by the Fighting Trees\r\n\r\nThe next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are now our ruler,\u201d he said to the Scarecrow; \u201cso you must come back to us as soon as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI certainly shall if I am able,\u201d the Scarecrow replied; \u201cbut I must help Dorothy to get home, first.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t try, my dear,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe should like to keep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a way.\u201d He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth and started upon their journey.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies, barking merrily all the time.\r\n\r\n\u201cCity life does not agree with me at all,\u201d remarked the Lion, as they walked along at a brisk pace. \u201cI have lost much flesh since I lived there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.\r\n\r\n\u201cOz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,\u201d added the Lion, \u201che would have been a brave man.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he had done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man, even if he was a bad Wizard.\r\n\r\nThe first day\u2019s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well indeed.\r\n\r\nIn the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers.\r\n\r\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is another space between the trees,\u201d called the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me try it first,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cfor it doesn\u2019t hurt me to get thrown about.\u201d He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is strange,\u201d exclaimed Dorothy. \u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our journey,\u201d remarked the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe I will try it myself,\u201d said the Woodman, and shouldering his axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d he shouted to the others. \u201cBe quick!\u201d They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\r\n\r\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it.\r\n\r\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will make a ladder,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \u201cfor we certainly must climb over the wall.\u201d\r\nChapter XX\r\nThe Dainty China Country\r\n\r\nWhile the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk. The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRest your brains and do not worry about the wall,\u201d replied the Woodman. \u201cWhen we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the other side.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the ladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said, \u201cOh, my!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d exclaimed Dorothy.\r\n\r\nSo the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, \u201cOh, my!\u201d just as the Scarecrow had done.\r\n\r\nThen Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him be still.\r\n\r\nThe Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but both of them cried, \u201cOh, my!\u201d as soon as they looked over the wall. When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and saw a strange sight.\r\n\r\nBefore them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors. These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy\u2019s waist. There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.\r\n\r\nBut the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy\u2019s knee.\r\n\r\nNo one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow shall we get down?\u201d asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThey found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cfor it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter.\r\n\r\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d cried the milkmaid angrily. \u201cSee what you have done! My cow has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender\u2019s shop and have it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d returned Dorothy. \u201cPlease forgive us.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side.\r\n\r\nDorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be very careful here,\u201d said the kind-hearted Woodman, \u201cor we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.\u201d\r\n\r\nA little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young Princess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away.\r\n\r\nDorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But the china girl cried out:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t chase me! Don\u2019t chase me!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away, \u201cif I run I may fall down and break myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut could you not be mended?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,\u201d replied the Princess.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose not,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,\u201d continued the china lady, \u201cwho is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn\u2019t look at all pretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nIndeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.\r\n\r\nThe Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:\r\n\r\n    \u201cMy lady fair,\r\n   Why do you stare\r\nAt poor old Mr. Joker?\r\n    You\u2019re quite as stiff\r\n    And prim as if\r\nYou\u2019d eaten up a poker!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBe quiet, sir!\u201d said the Princess. \u201cCan\u2019t you see these are strangers, and should be treated with respect?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s respect, I expect,\u201d declared the Clown, and immediately stood upon his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Mr. Joker,\u201d said the Princess to Dorothy. \u201cHe is considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind him a bit,\u201d said Dorothy. \u201cBut you are so beautiful,\u201d she continued, \u201cthat I am sure I could love you dearly. Won\u2019t you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em\u2019s mantel? I could carry you in my basket.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat would make me very unhappy,\u201d answered the china Princess. \u201cYou see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would not make you unhappy for all the world!\u201d exclaimed Dorothy. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just say good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d replied the Princess.\r\n\r\nThey walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall.\r\n\r\nIt was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the Lion\u2019s back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he jumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was too bad,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cbut really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow\u2019s leg and a church. They are all so brittle!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are, indeed,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cand I am thankful I am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow.\u201d\r\nChapter XXI\r\nThe Lion Becomes the King of Beasts\r\n\r\nAfter climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight. However, by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they reached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis forest is perfectly delightful,\u201d declared the Lion, looking around him with joy. \u201cNever have I seen a more beautiful place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems gloomy,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d answered the Lion. \u201cI should like to live here all my life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,\u201d said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose there are,\u201d returned the Lion, \u201cbut I do not see any of them about.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they heard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto whimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety. There were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion and bowed, saying:\r\n\r\n\u201cWelcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your trouble?\u201d asked the Lion quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are all threatened,\u201d answered the tiger, \u201cby a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lion thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre there any other lions in this forest?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And, besides, they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest?\u201d inquired the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will do that gladly,\u201d returned the tiger; and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar: \u201cWe will!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is this great spider of yours now?\u201d asked the Lion.\r\n\r\n\u201cYonder, among the oak trees,\u201d said the tiger, pointing with his forefoot.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake good care of these friends of mine,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cand I will go at once to fight the monster.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp\u2019s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster\u2019s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he knocked the spider\u2019s head from its body. Jumping down, he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quite dead.\r\n\r\nThe Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou need fear your enemy no longer.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas.\r\nChapter XXII\r\nThe Country of the Quadlings\r\n\r\nThe four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will be a hard climb,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cbut we must get over the hill, nevertheless.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, \u201cKeep back!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThen a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, \u201cThis hill belongs to us, and we don\u2019t allow anyone to cross it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we must cross it,\u201d said the Scarecrow. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the country of the Quadlings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you shall not!\u201d replied the voice, and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.\r\n\r\nHe was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms at all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not,\u201d and he walked boldly forward.\r\n\r\nAs quick as lightning the man\u2019s head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the hill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and the man laughed harshly as he said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t as easy as you think!\u201d\r\n\r\nA chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind every rock.\r\n\r\nThe Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow\u2019s mishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up the hill.\r\n\r\nAgain a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.\r\n\r\nDorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion came up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, \u201cIt is useless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can we do, then?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cCall the Winged Monkeys,\u201d suggested the Tin Woodman. \u201cYou have still the right to command them once more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered the magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few moments the entire band stood before her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are your commands?\u201d inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.\r\n\r\n\u201cCarry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,\u201d answered the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt shall be done,\u201d said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the last time you can summon us,\u201d said the leader to Dorothy; \u201cso good-bye and good luck to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, and thank you very much,\u201d returned the girl; and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.\r\n\r\nThe country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between, and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them. The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves, who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.\r\n\r\nThe Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer\u2019s wife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies, and a bowl of milk for Toto.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow far is it to the Castle of Glinda?\u201d asked the child.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not a great way,\u201d answered the farmer\u2019s wife. \u201cTake the road to the South and you will soon reach it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle. Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy approached, one of them said to her:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy have you come to the South Country?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo see the Good Witch who rules here,\u201d she answered. \u201cWill you take me to her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.\u201d They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle. After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once.\r\nChapter XXIII\r\nGlinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy\u2019s Wish\r\n\r\nBefore they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of the Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the Lion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.\r\n\r\nShe was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, my child?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\nDorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had met with.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy greatest wish now,\u201d she added, \u201cis to get back to Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.\u201d\r\n\r\nGlinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless your dear heart,\u201d she said, \u201cI am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas.\u201d Then she added, \u201cBut, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWillingly!\u201d exclaimed Dorothy; \u201cindeed, it is of no use to me now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I think I shall need their service just those three times,\u201d answered Glinda, smiling.\r\n\r\nDorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow, \u201cWhat will you do when Dorothy has left us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will return to the Emerald City,\u201d he replied, \u201cfor Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cfor it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I really wonderful?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are unusual,\u201d replied Glinda.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, \u201cWhat will become of you when Dorothy leaves this country?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, \u201cThe Winkies were very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy second command to the Winged Monkeys,\u201d said Glinda \u201cwill be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really brighter than he is\u2014when you are well polished\u2014and I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, \u201cWhen Dorothy has returned to her own home, what will become of you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOver the hill of the Hammer-Heads,\u201d he answered, \u201clies a grand old forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King. If I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy third command to the Winged Monkeys,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cshall be to carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,\u201d replied Glinda. \u201cIf you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you came to this country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut then I should not have had my wonderful brains!\u201d cried the Scarecrow. \u201cI might have passed my whole life in the farmer\u2019s cornfield.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I should not have had my lovely heart,\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \u201cI might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I should have lived a coward forever,\u201d declared the Lion, \u201cand no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is all true,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cand I am glad I was of use to these good friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired, and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should like to go back to Kansas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Silver Shoes,\u201d said the Good Witch, \u201chave wonderful powers. And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in the wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that is so,\u201d said the child joyfully, \u201cI will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms around the Lion\u2019s neck and kissed him, patting his big head tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face, and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades.\r\n\r\nGlinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself.\r\n\r\nDorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times, saying:\r\n\r\n\u201cTake me home to Aunt Em!\u201d\r\n\r\nInstantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, she sat up and looked about her.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood gracious!\u201d she cried.\r\n\r\nFor she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one. Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn, barking furiously.\r\n\r\nDorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet. For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert.\r\nChapter XXIV\r\nHome Again\r\n\r\nAunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy darling child!\u201d she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses. \u201cWhere in the world did you come from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom the Land of Oz,\u201d said Dorothy gravely. \u201cAnd here is Toto, too. And oh, Aunt Em! I\u2019m so glad to be at home again!\u201d\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ ***\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
