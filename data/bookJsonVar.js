Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an\r\nindividual\u2014he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom\r\nI knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.\r\n\r\nThe odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and\r\nslaves in the West at the period of this story\u2014that is to say, thirty or\r\nforty years ago.\r\n\r\nAlthough my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and\r\ngirls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,\r\nfor part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what\r\nthey once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,\r\nand what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nHARTFORD, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTom!\u201d\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cTOM!\u201d\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!\u201d\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the\r\nroom; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or\r\nnever looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were\r\nher state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \u201cstyle,\u201d not\r\nservice\u2014she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.\r\nShe looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but\r\nstill loud enough for the furniture to hear:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I lay if I get hold of you I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching\r\nunder the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\r\npunches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never did see the beat of that boy!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the\r\ntomato vines and \u201cjimpson\u201d weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So\r\nshe lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:\r\n\r\n\u201cY-o-u-u TOM!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize\r\na small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere! I might \u2019a\u2019 thought of that closet. What you been doing in\r\nthere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that\r\ntruck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I know. It\u2019s jam\u2014that\u2019s what it is. Forty times I\u2019ve said if you\r\ndidn\u2019t let that jam alone I\u2019d skin you. Hand me that switch.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe switch hovered in the air\u2014the peril was desperate\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy! Look behind you, aunt!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.\r\nThe lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and\r\ndisappeared over it.\r\n\r\nHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cHang the boy, can\u2019t I never learn anything? Ain\u2019t he played me tricks\r\nenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old\r\nfools is the biggest fools there is. Can\u2019t learn an old dog new tricks,\r\nas the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,\r\nand how is a body to know what\u2019s coming? He \u2019pears to know just how long\r\nhe can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make\r\nout to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it\u2019s all down again and\r\nI can\u2019t hit him a lick. I ain\u2019t doing my duty by that boy, and that\u2019s\r\nthe Lord\u2019s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as\r\nthe Good Book says. I\u2019m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I\r\nknow. He\u2019s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he\u2019s my own dead\r\nsister\u2019s boy, poor thing, and I ain\u2019t got the heart to lash him,\r\nsomehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and\r\nevery time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is\r\nborn of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,\r\nand I reckon it\u2019s so. He\u2019ll play hookey this evening,[*] and I\u2019ll just\r\nbe obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It\u2019s mighty hard\r\nto make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he\r\nhates work more than he hates anything else, and I\u2019ve _got_ to do some\r\nof my duty by him, or I\u2019ll be the ruination of the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n[*] Southwestern for \u201cafternoon\u201d\r\n\r\nTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home\r\nbarely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day\u2019s wood\r\nand split the kindlings before supper\u2014at least he was there in time\r\nto tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.\r\nTom\u2019s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through\r\nwith his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,\r\nand had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.\r\n\r\nWhile Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity\r\noffered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and\r\nvery deep\u2014for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like\r\nmany other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she\r\nwas endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\r\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low\r\ncunning. Said she:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, it was middling warm in school, warn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPowerful warm, warn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom\u2014a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He\r\nsearched Aunt Polly\u2019s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2019m\u2014well, not very much.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom\u2019s shirt, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you ain\u2019t too warm now, though.\u201d And it flattered her to reflect\r\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing\r\nthat that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew\r\nwhere the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of us pumped on our heads\u2014mine\u2019s damp yet. See?\u201d\r\n\r\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of\r\ncircumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new\r\ninspiration:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, you didn\u2019t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to\r\npump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom\u2019s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt\r\ncollar was securely sewed.\r\n\r\n\u201cBother! Well, go \u2019long with you. I\u2019d made sure you\u2019d played hookey\r\nand been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you\u2019re a kind of a\r\nsinged cat, as the saying is\u2014better\u2019n you look. _This_ time.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom\r\nhad stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\r\n\r\nBut Sidney said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, if I didn\u2019t think you sewed his collar with white thread,\r\nbut it\u2019s black.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I did sew it with white! Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cSiddy, I\u2019ll lick you for that.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into\r\nthe lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them\u2014one needle\r\ncarried white thread and the other black. He said:\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019d never noticed if it hadn\u2019t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes\r\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to\r\ngee-miny she\u2019d stick to one or t\u2019other\u2014I can\u2019t keep the run of \u2019em. But\r\nI bet you I\u2019ll lam Sid for that. I\u2019ll learn him!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well\r\nthough\u2014and loathed him.\r\n\r\nWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not\r\nbecause his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a\r\nman\u2019s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore\r\nthem down and drove them out of his mind for the time\u2014just as men\u2019s\r\nmisfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new\r\ninterest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired\r\nfrom a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It\r\nconsisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,\r\nproduced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short\r\nintervals in the midst of the music\u2014the reader probably remembers how to\r\ndo it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him\r\nthe knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of\r\nharmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer\r\nfeels who has discovered a new planet\u2014no doubt, as far as strong, deep,\r\nunalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\nThe summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom\r\nchecked his whistle. A stranger was before him\u2014a boy a shade larger\r\nthan himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive\r\ncuriosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy\r\nwas well dressed, too\u2014well dressed on a week-day. This was simply\r\nastounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth\r\nroundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes\r\non\u2014and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of\r\nribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom\u2019s vitals. The\r\nmore Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose\r\nat his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to\r\nhim to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved\u2014but only\r\nsidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the\r\ntime. Finally Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI can lick you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I can do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo you can\u2019t, either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo you can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\nAn uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t any of your business, maybe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell I \u2019low I\u2019ll _make_ it my business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you say much, I will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch\u2014much\u2014_much_. There now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you think you\u2019re mighty smart, _don\u2019t_ you? I could lick you with\r\none hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell I _will_, if you fool with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes\u2014I\u2019ve seen whole families in the same fix.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmarty! You think you\u2019re _some_, now, _don\u2019t_ you? Oh, what a hat!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can lump that hat if you don\u2019t like it. I dare you to knock it\r\noff\u2014and anybody that\u2019ll take a dare will suck eggs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a liar!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fighting liar and dasn\u2019t take it up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAw\u2014take a walk!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay\u2014if you give me much more of your sass I\u2019ll take and bounce a rock\r\noff\u2019n your head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, of _course_ you will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell I _will_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will\r\nfor? Why don\u2019t you _do_ it? It\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI _ain\u2019t_ afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ain\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently\r\nthey were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cGet away from here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo away yourself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t either.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both\r\nshoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But\r\nneither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and\r\nflushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a coward and a pup. I\u2019ll tell my big brother on you, and he can\r\nthrash you with his little finger, and I\u2019ll make him do it, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do I care for your big brother? I\u2019ve got a brother that\u2019s bigger\r\nthan he is\u2014and what\u2019s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.\u201d\r\n [Both brothers were imaginary.]\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Your_ saying so don\u2019t make it so.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare you to step over that, and I\u2019ll lick you till you can\u2019t stand\r\nup. Anybody that\u2019ll take a dare will steal sheep.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe new boy stepped over promptly, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you said you\u2019d do it, now let\u2019s see you do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you crowd me now; you better look out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you _said_ you\u2019d do it\u2014why don\u2019t you do it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out\r\nwith derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys\r\nwere rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and\r\nfor the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other\u2019s hair and\r\nclothes, punched and scratched each other\u2019s nose, and covered themselves\r\nwith dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the\r\nfog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him\r\nwith his fists. \u201cHoller \u2019nuff!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying\u2014mainly from rage.\r\n\r\n\u201cHoller \u2019nuff!\u201d\u2014and the pounding went on.\r\n\r\nAt last the stranger got out a smothered \u201c\u2019Nuff!\u201d and Tom let him up and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019ll learn you. Better look out who you\u2019re fooling with next\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,\r\nsnuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and\r\nthreatening what he would do to Tom the \u201cnext time he caught him out.\u201d\r\n To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and\r\nas soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it\r\nand hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like\r\nan antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he\r\nlived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the\r\nenemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the\r\nwindow and declined. At last the enemy\u2019s mother appeared, and called Tom\r\na bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but\r\nhe said he \u201c\u2019lowed\u201d to \u201clay\u201d for that boy.\r\n\r\nHe got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in\r\nat the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and\r\nwhen she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his\r\nSaturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its\r\nfirmness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and\r\nfresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if\r\nthe heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in\r\nevery face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom\r\nand the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond\r\nthe village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far\r\nenough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\r\n\r\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a\r\nlong-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\r\na deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board\r\nfence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a\r\nburden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost\r\nplank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant\r\nwhitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed\r\nfence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at\r\nthe gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from\r\nthe town pump had always been hateful work in Tom\u2019s eyes, before, but\r\nnow it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at\r\nthe pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there\r\nwaiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,\r\nskylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred\r\nand fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an\r\nhour\u2014and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Jim, I\u2019ll fetch the water if you\u2019ll whitewash some.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim shook his head and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an\u2019 git dis water\r\nan\u2019 not stop foolin\u2019 roun\u2019 wid anybody. She say she spec\u2019 Mars Tom gwine\r\nto ax me to whitewash, an\u2019 so she tole me go \u2019long an\u2019 \u2019tend to my own\r\nbusiness\u2014she \u2019lowed _she\u2019d_ \u2019tend to de whitewashin\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That\u2019s the way she always talks.\r\nGimme the bucket\u2014I won\u2019t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won\u2019t ever\r\nknow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I dasn\u2019t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she\u2019d take an\u2019 tar de head off\u2019n me.\r\n\u2019Deed she would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_She_! She never licks anybody\u2014whacks \u2019em over the head with her\r\nthimble\u2014and who cares for that, I\u2019d like to know. She talks awful, but\r\ntalk don\u2019t hurt\u2014anyways it don\u2019t if she don\u2019t cry. Jim, I\u2019ll give you a\r\nmarvel. I\u2019ll give you a white alley!\u201d\r\n\r\nJim began to waver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhite alley, Jim! And it\u2019s a bully taw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy! Dat\u2019s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I\u2019s powerful\r\n\u2019fraid ole missis\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd besides, if you will I\u2019ll show you my sore toe.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim was only human\u2014this attraction was too much for him. He put down\r\nhis pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing\r\ninterest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he\r\nwas flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\r\nwhitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with\r\na slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.\r\n\r\nBut Tom\u2019s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had\r\nplanned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys\r\nwould come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and\r\nthey would make a world of fun of him for having to work\u2014the very\r\nthought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and\r\nexamined it\u2014bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange\r\nof _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour\r\nof pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and\r\ngave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless\r\nmoment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,\r\nmagnificent inspiration.\r\n\r\nHe took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in\r\nsight presently\u2014the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\r\ndreading. Ben\u2019s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump\u2014proof enough that his\r\nheart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and\r\ngiving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\r\nding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As\r\nhe drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned\r\nfar over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp\r\nand circumstance\u2014for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered\r\nhimself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and\r\nengine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own\r\nhurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:\r\n\r\n\u201cStop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\u201d The headway ran almost out, and he\r\ndrew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\u201cShip up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!\u201d His arms straightened and stiffened\r\ndown his sides.\r\n\r\n\u201cSet her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!\r\nChow!\u201d His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles\u2014for it was\r\nrepresenting a forty-foot wheel.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!\u201d\r\n The left hand began to describe circles.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on\r\nthe stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!\r\nTing-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now!\r\nCome\u2014out with your spring-line\u2014what\u2019re you about there! Take a turn\r\nround that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now\u2014let her\r\ngo! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH\u2019T! S\u2019H\u2019T! SH\u2019T!\u201d\r\n(trying the gauge-cocks).\r\n\r\nTom went on whitewashing\u2014paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared\r\na moment and then said: \u201c_Hi-Yi! You\u2019re_ up a stump, ain\u2019t you!\u201d\r\n\r\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then\r\nhe gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as\r\nbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom\u2019s mouth watered for the\r\napple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s you, Ben! I warn\u2019t noticing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay\u2014I\u2019m going in a-swimming, I am. Don\u2019t you wish you could? But of\r\ncourse you\u2019d druther _work_\u2014wouldn\u2019t you? Course you would!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you call work?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, ain\u2019t _that_ work?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, maybe it is, and maybe it ain\u2019t. All I know, is, it suits Tom\r\nSawyer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh come, now, you don\u2019t mean to let on that you _like_ it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe brush continued to move.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike it? Well, I don\u2019t see why I oughtn\u2019t to like it. Does a boy get a\r\nchance to whitewash a fence every day?\u201d\r\n\r\nThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.\r\nTom swept his brush daintily back and forth\u2014stepped back to note the\r\neffect\u2014added a touch here and there\u2014criticised the effect again\u2014Ben\r\nwatching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more\r\nabsorbed. Presently he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014I reckon it wouldn\u2019t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly\u2019s awful\r\nparticular about this fence\u2014right here on the street, you know\u2014but if it\r\nwas the back fence I wouldn\u2019t mind and _she_ wouldn\u2019t. Yes, she\u2019s awful\r\nparticular about this fence; it\u2019s got to be done very careful; I reckon\r\nthere ain\u2019t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it\r\nthe way it\u2019s got to be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014is that so? Oh come, now\u2014lemme just try. Only just a little\u2014I\u2019d let\r\n_you_, if you was me, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBen, I\u2019d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly\u2014well, Jim wanted to do\r\nit, but she wouldn\u2019t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn\u2019t let\r\nSid. Now don\u2019t you see how I\u2019m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence\r\nand anything was to happen to it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, shucks, I\u2019ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say\u2014I\u2019ll give you\r\nthe core of my apple.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, here\u2014No, Ben, now don\u2019t. I\u2019m afeard\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you _all_ of it!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his\r\nheart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the\r\nsun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,\r\ndangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more\r\ninnocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every\r\nlittle while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time\r\nBen was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\r\na kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in\r\nfor a dead rat and a string to swing it with\u2014and so on, and so on, hour\r\nafter hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a\r\npoor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in\r\nwealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\r\nof a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool\r\ncannon, a key that wouldn\u2019t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a\r\nglass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,\r\nsix fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a\r\ndog-collar\u2014but no dog\u2014the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,\r\nand a dilapidated old window sash.\r\n\r\nHe had had a nice, good, idle time all the while\u2014plenty of company\u2014and\r\nthe fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn\u2019t run out of\r\nwhitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.\r\n\r\nTom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He\r\nhad discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it\u2014namely,\r\nthat in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary\r\nto make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and\r\nwise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have\r\ncomprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,\r\nand that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And\r\nthis would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or\r\nperforming on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing\r\nMont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England\r\nwho drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a\r\ndaily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable\r\nmoney; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn\r\nit into work and then they would resign.\r\n\r\nThe boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place\r\nin his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTom presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an\r\nopen window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,\r\nbreakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer\r\nair, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing\r\nmurmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her\r\nknitting\u2014for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her\r\nlap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had\r\nthought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at\r\nseeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He\r\nsaid: \u201cMayn\u2019t I go and play now, aunt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, a\u2019ready? How much have you done?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all done, aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, don\u2019t lie to me\u2014I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ain\u2019t, aunt; it _is_ all done.\u201d\r\n\r\nAunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for\r\nherself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of\r\nTom\u2019s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and\r\nnot only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a\r\nstreak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I never! There\u2019s no getting round it, you can work when you\u2019re a\r\nmind to, Tom.\u201d And then she diluted the compliment by adding, \u201cBut it\u2019s\r\npowerful seldom you\u2019re a mind to, I\u2019m bound to say. Well, go \u2019long and\r\nplay; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I\u2019ll tan you.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took\r\nhim into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,\r\nalong with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat\r\ntook to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.\r\nAnd while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he \u201chooked\u201d a\r\ndoughnut.\r\n\r\nThen he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway\r\nthat led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and\r\nthe air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a\r\nhail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties\r\nand sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,\r\nand Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general\r\nthing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at\r\npeace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his\r\nblack thread and getting him into trouble.\r\n\r\nTom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the\r\nback of his aunt\u2019s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach\r\nof capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the\r\nvillage, where two \u201cmilitary\u201d companies of boys had met for conflict,\r\naccording to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these\r\narmies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two\r\ngreat commanders did not condescend to fight in person\u2014that being better\r\nsuited to the still smaller fry\u2014but sat together on an eminence\r\nand conducted the field operations by orders delivered through\r\naides-de-camp. Tom\u2019s army won a great victory, after a long and\r\nhard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,\r\nthe terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the\r\nnecessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and\r\nmarched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.\r\n\r\nAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new\r\ngirl in the garden\u2014a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow\r\nhair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered\r\npantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A\r\ncertain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a\r\nmemory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;\r\nhe had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor\r\nlittle evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had\r\nconfessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest\r\nboy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time\r\nshe had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHe worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had\r\ndiscovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and\r\nbegan to \u201cshow off\u201d in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win\r\nher admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;\r\nbut by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic\r\nperformances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending\r\nher way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,\r\ngrieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a\r\nmoment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great\r\nsigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,\r\nright away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and\r\nthen shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as\r\nif he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.\r\nPresently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his\r\nnose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,\r\nin his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his\r\nbare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped\r\naway with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a\r\nminute\u2014only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next\r\nhis heart\u2014or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in\r\nanatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.\r\n\r\nHe returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, \u201cshowing\r\noff,\u201d as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom\r\ncomforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some\r\nwindow, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode\r\nhome reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.\r\n\r\nAll through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered \u201cwhat\r\nhad got into the child.\u201d He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and\r\ndid not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his\r\naunt\u2019s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:\r\n\r\n\u201cAunt, you don\u2019t whack Sid when he takes it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Sid don\u2019t torment a body the way you do. You\u2019d be always into\r\nthat sugar if I warn\u2019t watching you.\u201d\r\n\r\nPresently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,\r\nreached for the sugar-bowl\u2014a sort of glorying over Tom which was\r\nwellnigh unbearable. But Sid\u2019s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and\r\nbroke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled\r\nhis tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a\r\nword, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she\r\nasked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be\r\nnothing so good in the world as to see that pet model \u201ccatch it.\u201d He was\r\nso brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old\r\nlady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath\r\nfrom over her spectacles. He said to himself, \u201cNow it\u2019s coming!\u201d And the\r\nnext instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted\r\nto strike again when Tom cried out:\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on, now, what \u2019er you belting _me_ for?\u2014Sid broke it!\u201d\r\n\r\nAunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when\r\nshe got her tongue again, she only said:\r\n\r\n\u201cUmf! Well, you didn\u2019t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some\r\nother audacious mischief when I wasn\u2019t around, like enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something\r\nkind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a\r\nconfession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.\r\nSo she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.\r\nTom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart\r\nhis aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the\r\nconsciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice\r\nof none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,\r\nthrough a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured\r\nhimself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching\r\none little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and\r\ndie with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured\r\nhimself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and\r\nhis sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how\r\nher tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back\r\nher boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would\r\nlie there cold and white and make no sign\u2014a poor little sufferer, whose\r\ngriefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of\r\nthese dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;\r\nand his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,\r\nand ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to\r\nhim was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any\r\nworldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too\r\nsacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced\r\nin, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit\r\nof one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness\r\nout at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.\r\n\r\nHe wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate\r\nplaces that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river\r\ninvited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated\r\nthe dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could\r\nonly be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the\r\nuncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.\r\nHe got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal\r\nfelicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she\r\ncry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and\r\ncomfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?\r\nThis picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he\r\nworked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and\r\nvaried lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing\r\nand departed in the darkness.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past nine or ten o\u2019clock he came along the deserted street to\r\nwhere the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\r\nhis listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain\r\nof a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the\r\nfence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under\r\nthat window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him\r\ndown on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\r\nhands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.\r\nAnd thus he would die\u2014out in the cold world, with no shelter over his\r\nhomeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,\r\nno loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And\r\nthus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and\r\noh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would\r\nshe heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,\r\nso untimely cut down?\r\n\r\nThe window went up, a maid-servant\u2019s discordant voice profaned the holy\r\ncalm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr\u2019s remains!\r\n\r\nThe strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz\r\nas of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\r\nas of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the\r\nfence and shot away in the gloom.\r\n\r\nNot long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his\r\ndrenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he\r\nhad any dim idea of making any \u201creferences to allusions,\u201d he thought\r\nbetter of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom\u2019s eye.\r\n\r\nTom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental\r\nnote of the omission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful\r\nvillage like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family\r\nworship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid\r\ncourses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of\r\noriginality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of\r\nthe Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\r\n\r\nThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to \u201cget\r\nhis verses.\u201d Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his\r\nenergies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the\r\nSermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.\r\nAt the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,\r\nbut no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human\r\nthought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took\r\nhis book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the\r\nfog:\r\n\r\n\u201cBlessed are the\u2014a\u2014a\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014poor; blessed are the poor\u2014a\u2014a\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn spirit\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they\u2014they\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Theirs_\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom\r\nof heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they\u2014they\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSh\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor they\u2014a\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cS, H, A\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor they S, H\u2014Oh, I don\u2019t know what it is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Shall_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, _shall_! for they shall\u2014for they shall\u2014a\u2014a\u2014shall\r\nmourn\u2014a\u2014a\u2014blessed are they that shall\u2014they that\u2014a\u2014they that\r\nshall mourn, for they shall\u2014a\u2014shall _what_? Why don\u2019t you tell me,\r\nMary?\u2014what do you want to be so mean for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I\u2019m not teasing you. I wouldn\u2019t\r\ndo that. You must go and learn it again. Don\u2019t you be discouraged, Tom,\r\nyou\u2019ll manage it\u2014and if you do, I\u2019ll give you something ever so nice.\r\nThere, now, that\u2019s a good boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever you mind, Tom. You know if I say it\u2019s nice, it is nice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou bet you that\u2019s so, Mary. All right, I\u2019ll tackle it again.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he did \u201ctackle it again\u201d\u2014and under the double pressure of curiosity\r\nand prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a\r\nshining success. Mary gave him a brand-new \u201cBarlow\u201d knife worth twelve\r\nand a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system\r\nshook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,\r\nbut it was a \u201csure-enough\u201d Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur\r\nin that\u2014though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a\r\nweapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing\r\nmystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the\r\ncupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\r\ncalled off to dress for Sunday-school.\r\n\r\nMary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went\r\noutside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\r\ndipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;\r\npoured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen\r\nand began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But\r\nMary removed the towel and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow ain\u2019t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn\u2019t be so bad. Water won\u2019t hurt\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he\r\nstood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath\r\nand began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut\r\nand groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of\r\nsuds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from\r\nthe towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped\r\nshort at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\r\nthere was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in\r\nfront and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she\r\nwas done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of\r\ncolor, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls\r\nwrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately\r\nsmoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his\r\nhair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his\r\nown filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his\r\nclothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years\u2014they were\r\nsimply called his \u201cother clothes\u201d\u2014and so by that we know the size of his\r\nwardrobe. The girl \u201cput him to rights\u201d after he had dressed himself;\r\nshe buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt\r\ncollar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with\r\nhis speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and\r\nuncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there\r\nwas a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He\r\nhoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she\r\ncoated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought\r\nthem out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do\r\neverything he didn\u2019t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, Tom\u2014that\u2019s a good boy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three\r\nchildren set out for Sunday-school\u2014a place that Tom hated with his whole\r\nheart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.\r\n\r\nSabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church\r\nservice. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\r\nand the other always remained too\u2014for stronger reasons. The church\u2019s\r\nhigh-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;\r\nthe edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board\r\ntree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step\r\nand accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Billy, got a yaller ticket?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you take for her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you give?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPiece of lickrish and a fish-hook.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLess see \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.\r\nThen Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some\r\nsmall trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other\r\nboys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten\r\nor fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm\r\nof clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started\r\na quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,\r\nelderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a\r\nboy\u2019s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy\r\nturned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear\r\nhim say \u201cOuch!\u201d and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom\u2019s whole\r\nclass were of a pattern\u2014restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came\r\nto recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but\r\nhad to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each\r\ngot his reward\u2014in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\r\non it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten\r\nblue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red\r\ntickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent\r\ngave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy\r\ntimes) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and\r\napplication to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dor\u00e9 Bible? And\r\nyet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way\u2014it was the patient work of\r\ntwo years\u2014and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once\r\nrecited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his\r\nmental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot\r\nfrom that day forth\u2014a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great\r\noccasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)\r\nhad always made this boy come out and \u201cspread himself.\u201d Only the older\r\npupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\r\nlong enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes\r\nwas a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so\r\ngreat and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar\u2019s\r\nheart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple\r\nof weeks. It is possible that Tom\u2019s mental stomach had never really\r\nhungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\r\nhad for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.\r\n\r\nIn due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with\r\na closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\r\nleaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent\r\nmakes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as\r\nnecessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\r\nwho stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert\u2014though\r\nwhy, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music\r\nis ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim\r\ncreature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he\r\nwore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears\r\nand whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth\u2014a\r\nfence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the\r\nwhole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a\r\nspreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had\r\nfringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion\r\nof the day, like sleigh-runners\u2014an effect patiently and laboriously\r\nproduced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a\r\nwall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very\r\nsincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places\r\nin such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that\r\nunconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar\r\nintonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as\r\nyou can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There\u2014that\r\nis it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one\r\nlittle girl who is looking out of the window\u2014I am afraid she thinks I\r\nam out there somewhere\u2014perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech\r\nto the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it\r\nmakes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a\r\nplace like this, learning to do right and be good.\u201d And so forth and so\r\non. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a\r\npattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\r\n\r\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights\r\nand other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings\r\nand whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of\r\nisolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound\r\nceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters\u2019 voice, and the\r\nconclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\r\n\r\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was\r\nmore or less rare\u2014the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied\r\nby a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman\r\nwith iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter\u2019s\r\nwife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of\r\nchafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too\u2014he could not meet Amy\r\nLawrence\u2019s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this\r\nsmall newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next\r\nmoment he was \u201cshowing off\u201d with all his might\u2014cuffing boys, pulling\r\nhair, making faces\u2014in a word, using every art that seemed likely to\r\nfascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one\r\nalloy\u2014the memory of his humiliation in this angel\u2019s garden\u2014and that\r\nrecord in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that\r\nwere sweeping over it now.\r\n\r\nThe visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.\r\nWalters\u2019 speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The\r\nmiddle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage\u2014no less a one\r\nthan the county judge\u2014altogether the most august creation these children\r\nhad ever looked upon\u2014and they wondered what kind of material he was made\r\nof\u2014and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,\r\ntoo. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away\u2014so he had travelled,\r\nand seen the world\u2014these very eyes had looked upon the county\r\ncourt-house\u2014which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these\r\nreflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the\r\nranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of\r\ntheir own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\r\nwith the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music\r\nto his soul to hear the whisperings:\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at him, Jim! He\u2019s a going up there. Say\u2014look! he\u2019s a going to\r\nshake hands with him\u2014he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don\u2019t you\r\nwish you was Jeff?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Walters fell to \u201cshowing off,\u201d with all sorts of official bustlings\r\nand activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging\r\ndirections here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The\r\nlibrarian \u201cshowed off\u201d\u2014running hither and thither with his arms full of\r\nbooks and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority\r\ndelights in. The young lady teachers \u201cshowed off\u201d\u2014bending sweetly over\r\npupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers\r\nat bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen\r\nteachers \u201cshowed off\u201d with small scoldings and other little displays of\r\nauthority and fine attention to discipline\u2014and most of the teachers, of\r\nboth sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was\r\nbusiness that frequently had to be done over again two or three times\r\n(with much seeming vexation). The little girls \u201cshowed off\u201d in various\r\nways, and the little boys \u201cshowed off\u201d with such diligence that the air\r\nwas thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it\r\nall the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all\r\nthe house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur\u2014for he was\r\n\u201cshowing off,\u201d too.\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters\u2019 ecstasy complete,\r\nand that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.\r\nSeveral pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough\u2014he had been\r\naround among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,\r\nto have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\r\n\r\nAnd now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with\r\nnine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded\r\na Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not\r\nexpecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But\r\nthere was no getting around it\u2014here were the certified checks, and they\r\nwere good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\r\nthe Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from\r\nheadquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and\r\nso profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the\r\njudicial one\u2019s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\r\nin place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy\u2014but those that\r\nsuffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they\r\nthemselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to\r\nTom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.\r\nThese despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a\r\nguileful snake in the grass.\r\n\r\nThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the\r\nsuperintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked\r\nsomewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow\u2019s instinct taught him\r\nthat there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,\r\nperhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two\r\nthousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises\u2014a dozen would\r\nstrain his capacity, without a doubt.\r\n\r\nAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in\r\nher face\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain\r\ntroubled; next a dim suspicion came and went\u2014came again; she watched;\r\na furtive glance told her worlds\u2014and then her heart broke, and she was\r\njealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most\r\nof all (she thought).\r\n\r\nTom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath\r\nwould hardly come, his heart quaked\u2014partly because of the awful\r\ngreatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would\r\nhave liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The\r\nJudge put his hand on Tom\u2019s head and called him a fine little man, and\r\nasked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, not Tom\u2014it is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThomas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That\u2019s very well.\r\nBut you\u2019ve another one I daresay, and you\u2019ll tell it to me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,\u201d said Walters, \u201cand say\r\nsir. You mustn\u2019t forget your manners.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThomas Sawyer\u2014sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two\r\nthousand verses is a great many\u2014very, very great many. And you never can\r\nbe sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth\r\nmore than anything there is in the world; it\u2019s what makes great men\r\nand good men; you\u2019ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some\r\nday, Thomas, and then you\u2019ll look back and say, It\u2019s all owing to the\r\nprecious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood\u2014it\u2019s all owing to\r\nmy dear teachers that taught me to learn\u2014it\u2019s all owing to the good\r\nsuperintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a\r\nbeautiful Bible\u2014a splendid elegant Bible\u2014to keep and have it all for my\r\nown, always\u2014it\u2019s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will\r\nsay, Thomas\u2014and you wouldn\u2019t take any money for those two thousand\r\nverses\u2014no indeed you wouldn\u2019t. And now you wouldn\u2019t mind telling me and\r\nthis lady some of the things you\u2019ve learned\u2014no, I know you wouldn\u2019t\u2014for\r\nwe are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names\r\nof all the twelve disciples. Won\u2019t you tell us the names of the first\r\ntwo that were appointed?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,\r\nnow, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters\u2019 heart sank within him. He said\r\nto himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest\r\nquestion\u2014why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up\r\nand say:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnswer the gentleman, Thomas\u2014don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom still hung fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I know you\u2019ll tell me,\u201d said the lady. \u201cThe names of the first two\r\ndisciples were\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_David and Goliah!_\u201d\r\n\r\nLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,\r\nand presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The\r\nSunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and\r\noccupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt\r\nPolly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her\u2014Tom being placed next\r\nthe aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window\r\nand the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up\r\nthe aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;\r\nthe mayor and his wife\u2014for they had a mayor there, among other\r\nunnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair,\r\nsmart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill\r\nmansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much\r\nthe most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could\r\nboast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the\r\nnew notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by\r\na troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all\r\nthe young clerks in town in a body\u2014for they had stood in the vestibule\r\nsucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering\r\nadmirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came\r\nthe Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as\r\nif she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was\r\nthe pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so\r\ngood. And besides, he had been \u201cthrown up to them\u201d so much. His\r\nwhite handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on\r\nSundays\u2014accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys\r\nwho had as snobs.\r\n\r\nThe congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,\r\nto warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the\r\nchurch which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the\r\nchoir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all\r\nthrough service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,\r\nbut I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,\r\nand I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in\r\nsome foreign country.\r\n\r\nThe minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a\r\npeculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His\r\nvoice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a\r\ncertain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word\r\nand then plunged down as if from a spring-board:\r\n\r\n  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow\u2019ry _beds_\r\n                                                        of ease,\r\n\r\n  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro\u2019 _blood_\r\n                                                        -y seas?\r\n\r\nHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church \u201csociables\u201d he was\r\nalways called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies\r\nwould lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,\r\nand \u201cwall\u201d their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, \u201cWords\r\ncannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal\r\nearth.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into\r\na bulletin-board, and read off \u201cnotices\u201d of meetings and societies and\r\nthings till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of\r\ndoom\u2014a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,\r\naway here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is\r\nto justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went\r\ninto details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the\r\nchurch; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;\r\nfor the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United\r\nStates; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the\r\nPresident; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed\r\nby stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of\r\nEuropean monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\r\nand the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear\r\nwithal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with\r\na supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace\r\nand favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a\r\ngrateful harvest of good. Amen.\r\n\r\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.\r\nThe boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he\r\nonly endured it\u2014if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;\r\nhe kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously\u2014for he was not\r\nlistening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman\u2019s regular\r\nroute over it\u2014and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\r\nhis ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered\r\nadditions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had\r\nlit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by\r\ncalmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and\r\npolishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with\r\nthe body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping\r\nits wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they\r\nhad been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if\r\nit knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom\u2019s\r\nhands itched to grab for it they did not dare\u2014he believed his soul would\r\nbe instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going\r\non. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal\r\nforward; and the instant the \u201cAmen\u201d was out the fly was a prisoner of\r\nwar. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.\r\n\r\nThe minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an\r\nargument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod\u2014and\r\nyet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and\r\nthinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly\r\nworth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he\r\nalways knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything\r\nelse about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested\r\nfor a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the\r\nassembling together of the world\u2019s hosts at the millennium when the lion\r\nand the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead\r\nthem. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle\r\nwere lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the\r\nprincipal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the\r\nthought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,\r\nif it was a tame lion.\r\n\r\nNow he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\r\nPresently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was\r\na large black beetle with formidable jaws\u2014a \u201cpinchbug,\u201d he called it. It\r\nwas in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to\r\ntake him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went\r\nfloundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went\r\ninto the boy\u2019s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,\r\nunable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\r\nof his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in\r\nthe beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came\r\nidling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the\r\nquiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the\r\ndrooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around\r\nit; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew\r\nbolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly\r\nsnatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\r\nthe diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,\r\nand continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent\r\nand absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin\r\ndescended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,\r\na flirt of the poodle\u2019s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards\r\naway, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators\r\nshook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and\r\nhand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,\r\nand probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a\r\ncraving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on\r\nit again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his\r\nfore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at\r\nit with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But\r\nhe grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a\r\nfly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close\r\nto the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the\r\nbeetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony\r\nand the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so\r\ndid the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew\r\ndown the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the\r\nhome-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was\r\nbut a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of\r\nlight. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang\r\ninto its master\u2019s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of\r\ndistress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.\r\n\r\nBy this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with\r\nsuppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.\r\nThe discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all\r\npossibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest\r\nsentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of\r\nunholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson\r\nhad said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole\r\ncongregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.\r\n\r\nTom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was\r\nsome satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety\r\nin it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog\r\nshould play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in\r\nhim to carry it off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found\r\nhim so\u2014because it began another week\u2019s slow suffering in school. He\r\ngenerally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,\r\nit made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.\r\n\r\nTom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was\r\nsick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.\r\nHe canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated\r\nagain. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he\r\nbegan to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew\r\nfeeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly\r\nhe discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This\r\nwas lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a \u201cstarter,\u201d as he\r\ncalled it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that\r\nargument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought\r\nhe would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.\r\nNothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing\r\nthe doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or\r\nthree weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly\r\ndrew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.\r\nBut now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed\r\nwell worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nBut Sid slept on unconscious.\r\n\r\nTom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.\r\n\r\nNo result from Sid.\r\n\r\nTom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then\r\nswelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.\r\n\r\nSid snored on.\r\n\r\nTom was aggravated. He said, \u201cSid, Sid!\u201d and shook him. This course\r\nworked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then\r\nbrought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.\r\nTom went on groaning. Sid said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom! Say, Tom!\u201d [No response.] \u201cHere, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,\r\nTom?\u201d And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.\r\n\r\nTom moaned out:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t, Sid. Don\u2019t joggle me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014never mind. It\u2019ll be over by and by, maybe. Don\u2019t call anybody.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I must! _Don\u2019t_ groan so, Tom, it\u2019s awful. How long you been this\r\nway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHours. Ouch! Oh, don\u2019t stir so, Sid, you\u2019ll kill me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, why didn\u2019t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don\u2019t!_ It makes my flesh\r\ncrawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you\u2019ve ever done to\r\nme. When I\u2019m gone\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tom, you ain\u2019t dying, are you? Don\u2019t, Tom\u2014oh, don\u2019t. Maybe\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell \u2019em so, Sid. And Sid, you give\r\nmy window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that\u2019s come to\r\ntown, and tell her\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,\r\nnow, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had\r\ngathered quite a genuine tone.\r\n\r\nSid flew downstairs and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom\u2019s dying!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDying!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2019m. Don\u2019t wait\u2014come quick!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRubbage! I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.\r\nAnd her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the\r\nbedside she gasped out:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou, Tom! Tom, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, auntie, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you\u2014what is the matter with you, child?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, auntie, my sore toe\u2019s mortified!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a\r\nlittle, then did both together. This restored her and she said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and\r\nclimb out of this.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a\r\nlittle foolish, and he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cAunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my\r\ntooth at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour tooth, indeed! What\u2019s the matter with your tooth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of them\u2019s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, there, now, don\u2019t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.\r\nWell\u2014your tooth _is_ loose, but you\u2019re not going to die about that.\r\nMary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, please, auntie, don\u2019t pull it out. It don\u2019t hurt any more. I wish\r\nI may never stir if it does. Please don\u2019t, auntie. I don\u2019t want to stay\r\nhome from school.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t, don\u2019t you? So all this row was because you thought you\u2019d\r\nget to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,\r\nand you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your\r\noutrageousness.\u201d By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old\r\nlady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom\u2019s tooth with a loop\r\nand tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and\r\nsuddenly thrust it almost into the boy\u2019s face. The tooth hung dangling\r\nby the bedpost, now.\r\n\r\nBut all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after\r\nbreakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his\r\nupper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable\r\nway. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;\r\nand one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and\r\nhomage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,\r\nand shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain\r\nwhich he did not feel that it wasn\u2019t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;\r\nbut another boy said, \u201cSour grapes!\u201d and he wandered away a dismantled\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry\r\nFinn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and\r\ndreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless\r\nand vulgar and bad\u2014and because all their children admired him so, and\r\ndelighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like\r\nhim. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied\r\nHuckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders\r\nnot to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.\r\nHuckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown\r\nmen, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat\r\nwas a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,\r\nwhen he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons\r\nfar down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of\r\nthe trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged\r\nin the dirt when not rolled up.\r\n\r\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps\r\nin fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to\r\nschool or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could\r\ngo fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it\r\nsuited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he\r\npleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring\r\nand the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor\r\nput on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything\r\nthat goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,\r\nhampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nTom hailed the romantic outcast:\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, Huckleberry!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHello yourself, and see how you like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you got?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDead cat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLemme see him, Huck. My, he\u2019s pretty stiff. Where\u2019d you get him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBought him off\u2019n a boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you give?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the blue ticket?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBought it off\u2019n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay\u2014what is dead cats good for, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood for? Cure warts with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! Is that so? I know something that\u2019s better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet you don\u2019t. What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, spunk-water.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSpunk-water! I wouldn\u2019t give a dern for spunk-water.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t you? D\u2019you ever try it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I hain\u2019t. But Bob Tanner did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho told you so!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny\r\ntold Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the\r\nnigger told me. There now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what of it? They\u2019ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I\r\ndon\u2019t know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn\u2019t_ lie. Shucks!\r\nNow you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water\r\nwas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the daytime?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith his face to the stump?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Least I reckon so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he say anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon he did. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool\r\nway as that! Why, that ain\u2019t a-going to do any good. You got to go all\r\nby yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there\u2019s a\r\nspunk-water stump, and just as it\u2019s midnight you back up against the\r\nstump and jam your hand in and say:\r\n\r\n    \u2018Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,\r\n    Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,\u2019\r\n\r\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then\r\nturn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.\r\nBecause if you speak the charm\u2019s busted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that sounds like a good way; but that ain\u2019t the way Bob Tanner\r\ndone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, you can bet he didn\u2019t, becuz he\u2019s the wartiest boy in this\r\ntown; and he wouldn\u2019t have a wart on him if he\u2019d knowed how to work\r\nspunk-water. I\u2019ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,\r\nHuck. I play with frogs so much that I\u2019ve always got considerable many\r\nwarts. Sometimes I take \u2019em off with a bean.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, bean\u2019s good. I\u2019ve done that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you? What\u2019s your way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,\r\nand then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig\r\na hole and bury it \u2019bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the\r\nmoon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece\r\nthat\u2019s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to\r\nfetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the\r\nwart, and pretty soon off she comes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s it, Huck\u2014that\u2019s it; though when you\u2019re burying it if you\r\nsay \u2018Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!\u2019 it\u2019s better.\r\nThat\u2019s the way Joe Harper does, and he\u2019s been nearly to Coonville and\r\nmost everywheres. But say\u2014how do you cure \u2019em with dead cats?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard \u2019long about\r\nmidnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it\u2019s\r\nmidnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can\u2019t see\r\n\u2019em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear \u2019em talk;\r\nand when they\u2019re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after \u2019em\r\nand say, \u2018Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I\u2019m\r\ndone with ye!\u2019 That\u2019ll fetch _any_ wart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSounds right. D\u2019you ever try it, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but old Mother Hopkins told me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I reckon it\u2019s so, then. Becuz they say she\u2019s a witch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own\r\nself. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he\r\ntook up a rock, and if she hadn\u2019t dodged, he\u2019d a got her. Well, that\r\nvery night he rolled off\u2019n a shed wher\u2019 he was a layin drunk, and broke\r\nhis arm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right\r\nstiddy, they\u2019re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when\r\nthey mumble they\u2019re saying the Lord\u2019s Prayer backards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-night. I reckon they\u2019ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they buried him Saturday. Didn\u2019t they get him Saturday night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?\u2014and\r\n_then_ it\u2019s Sunday. Devils don\u2019t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don\u2019t\r\nreckon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never thought of that. That\u2019s so. Lemme go with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course\u2014if you ain\u2019t afeard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfeard! \u2019Tain\u2019t likely. Will you meow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep\u2019 me\r\na-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says\r\n\u2018Dern that cat!\u2019 and so I hove a brick through his window\u2014but don\u2019t you\r\ntell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but\r\nI\u2019ll meow this time. Say\u2014what\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing but a tick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOut in the woods.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you take for him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to sell him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. It\u2019s a mighty small tick, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, anybody can run a tick down that don\u2019t belong to them. I\u2019m\r\nsatisfied with it. It\u2019s a good enough tick for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSho, there\u2019s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of \u2019em if I wanted\r\nto.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can\u2019t. This is a\r\npretty early tick, I reckon. It\u2019s the first one I\u2019ve seen this year.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Huck\u2014I\u2019ll give you my tooth for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLess see it.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed\r\nit wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it genuwyne?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, all right,\u201d said Huckleberry, \u201cit\u2019s a trade.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the\r\npinchbug\u2019s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in\r\nbriskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He\r\nhung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like\r\nalacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom\r\narm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The\r\ninterruption roused him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThomas Sawyer!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of\r\nyellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric\r\nsympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the\r\ngirls\u2019 side of the school-house. He instantly said:\r\n\r\n\u201c_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_\u201d\r\n\r\nThe master\u2019s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of\r\nstudy ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his\r\nmind. The master said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2014you did what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the words.\r\n\r\n\u201cThomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever\r\nlistened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your\r\njacket.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe master\u2019s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches\r\nnotably diminished. Then the order followed:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but\r\nin reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\r\nof his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good\r\nfortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched\r\nherself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and\r\nwhispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the\r\nlong, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\r\n\r\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur\r\nrose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal\r\nfurtive glances at the girl. She observed it, \u201cmade a mouth\u201d at him\r\nand gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she\r\ncautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it\r\naway. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less\r\nanimosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it\r\nremain. Tom scrawled on his slate, \u201cPlease take it\u2014I got more.\u201d The\r\ngirl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw\r\nsomething on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time\r\nthe girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began\r\nto manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,\r\napparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt\r\nto see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she\r\ngave in and hesitatingly whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see it.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends\r\nto it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl\u2019s\r\ninterest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything\r\nelse. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice\u2014make a man.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He\r\ncould have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\r\nshe was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful man\u2014now make me coming along.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed\r\nthe spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ever so nice\u2014I wish I could draw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d whispered Tom, \u201cI\u2019ll learn you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, will you? When?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt noon. Do you go home to dinner?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay if you will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood\u2014that\u2019s a whack. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecky Thatcher. What\u2019s yours? Oh, I know. It\u2019s Thomas Sawyer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the name they lick me by. I\u2019m Tom when I\u2019m good. You call me\r\nTom, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from\r\nthe girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it ain\u2019t anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo it ain\u2019t. You don\u2019t want to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo I won\u2019t\u2014deed and deed and double deed won\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, _you_ don\u2019t want to see!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow that you treat me so, I _will_ see.\u201d And she put her small hand\r\nupon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in\r\nearnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were\r\nrevealed: \u201c_I love you_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you bad thing!\u201d And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and\r\nlooked pleased, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his\r\near, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the\r\nhouse and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles\r\nfrom the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful\r\nmoments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But\r\nalthough Tom\u2019s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.\r\n\r\nAs the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but\r\nthe turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the\r\nreading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and\r\nturned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into\r\ncontinents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and\r\ngot \u201cturned down,\u201d by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought\r\nup at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\r\nostentation for months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas\r\nwandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed\r\nto him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.\r\nThere was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.\r\nThe drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed\r\nthe soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the\r\nflaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a\r\nshimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds\r\nfloated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible\r\nbut some cows, and they were asleep. Tom\u2019s heart ached to be free, or\r\nelse to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.\r\nHis hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of\r\ngratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively\r\nthe percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on\r\nthe long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that\r\namounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when\r\nhe started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and\r\nmade him take a new direction.\r\n\r\nTom\u2019s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and\r\nnow he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in\r\nan instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn\r\nfriends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a\r\npin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.\r\nThe sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were\r\ninterfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit\r\nof the tick. So he put Joe\u2019s slate on the desk and drew a line down the\r\nmiddle of it from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cas long as he is on your side you can stir him up and\r\nI\u2019ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,\r\nyou\u2019re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, go ahead; start him up.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe\r\nharassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This\r\nchange of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with\r\nabsorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the\r\ntwo heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all\r\nthings else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The\r\ntick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as\r\nanxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would\r\nhave victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom\u2019s fingers would\r\nbe twitching to begin, Joe\u2019s pin would deftly head him off, and keep\r\npossession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too\r\nstrong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in\r\na moment. Said he:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, you let him alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, it ain\u2019t fair; you just let him alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame it, I ain\u2019t going to stir him much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet him alone, I tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall\u2014he\u2019s on my side of the line.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whose tick he is\u2014he\u2019s on my side of the line, and you\r\nsha\u2019n\u2019t touch him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll just bet I will, though. He\u2019s my tick and I\u2019ll do what I\r\nblame please with him, or die!\u201d\r\n\r\nA tremendous whack came down on Tom\u2019s shoulders, and its duplicate on\r\nJoe\u2019s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from\r\nthe two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been\r\ntoo absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile\r\nbefore when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.\r\nHe had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed\r\nhis bit of variety to it.\r\n\r\nWhen school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered\r\nin her ear:\r\n\r\n\u201cPut on your bonnet and let on you\u2019re going home; and when you get to\r\nthe corner, give the rest of \u2019em the slip, and turn down through the\r\nlane and come back. I\u2019ll go the other way and come it over \u2019em the same\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with\r\nanother. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and\r\nwhen they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they\r\nsat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil\r\nand held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising\r\nhouse. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.\r\nTom was swimming in bliss. He said:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you love rats?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! I hate them!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I do, too\u2014_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your\r\nhead with a string.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you? I\u2019ve got some. I\u2019ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give\r\nit back to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs\r\nagainst the bench in excess of contentment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWas you ever at a circus?\u201d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and my pa\u2019s going to take me again some time, if I\u2019m good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI been to the circus three or four times\u2014lots of times. Church ain\u2019t\r\nshucks to a circus. There\u2019s things going on at a circus all the time.\r\nI\u2019m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, are you! That will be nice. They\u2019re so lovely, all spotted up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s so. And they get slathers of money\u2014most a dollar a day, Ben\r\nRogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, engaged to be married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon so. I don\u2019t know. What is it like?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLike? Why it ain\u2019t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won\u2019t\r\never have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that\u2019s\r\nall. Anybody can do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKiss? What do you kiss for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that, you know, is to\u2014well, they always do that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEverybody?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes, everybody that\u2019s in love with each other. Do you remember\r\nwhat I wrote on the slate?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYe\u2014yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI sha\u2019n\u2019t tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I tell _you_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYe\u2014yes\u2014but some other time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not now\u2014to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, _now_. Please, Becky\u2014I\u2019ll whisper it, I\u2019ll whisper it ever so\r\neasy.\u201d\r\n\r\nBecky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about\r\nher waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to\r\nher ear. And then he added:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you whisper it to me\u2014just the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe resisted, for a while, and then said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou turn your face away so you can\u2019t see, and then I will. But you\r\nmustn\u2019t ever tell anybody\u2014_will_ you, Tom? Now you won\u2019t, _will_ you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed, indeed I won\u2019t. Now, Becky.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred\r\nhis curls and whispered, \u201cI\u2014love\u2014you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,\r\nwith Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little\r\nwhite apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Becky, it\u2019s all done\u2014all over but the kiss. Don\u2019t you be afraid\r\nof that\u2014it ain\u2019t anything at all. Please, Becky.\u201d And he tugged at her\r\napron and the hands.\r\n\r\nBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing\r\nwith the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow it\u2019s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain\u2019t\r\never to love anybody but me, and you ain\u2019t ever to marry anybody but me,\r\never never and forever. Will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I\u2019ll never marry anybody\r\nbut you\u2014and you ain\u2019t to ever marry anybody but me, either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. Of course. That\u2019s _part_ of it. And always coming to school\r\nor when we\u2019re going home, you\u2019re to walk with me, when there ain\u2019t\r\nanybody looking\u2014and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because\r\nthat\u2019s the way you do when you\u2019re engaged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice. I never heard of it before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tom! Then I ain\u2019t the first you\u2019ve ever been engaged to!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe child began to cry. Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t cry, Becky, I don\u2019t care for her any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you do, Tom\u2014you know you do.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and\r\nturned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with\r\nsoothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was\r\nup, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and\r\nuneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping\r\nshe would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began\r\nto feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle\r\nwith him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and\r\nentered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with\r\nher face to the wall. Tom\u2019s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a\r\nmoment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\u201cBecky, I\u2014I don\u2019t care for anybody but you.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo reply\u2014but sobs.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecky\u201d\u2014pleadingly. \u201cBecky, won\u2019t you say something?\u201d\r\n\r\nMore sobs.\r\n\r\nTom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,\r\nand passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, Becky, won\u2019t you take it?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over\r\nthe hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently\r\nBecky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she\r\nflew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom! Come back, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions\r\nbut silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid\r\nherself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she\r\nhad to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross\r\nof a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about\r\nher to exchange sorrows with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the\r\ntrack of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed\r\na small \u201cbranch\u201d two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile\r\nsuperstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later\r\nhe was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff\r\nHill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the\r\nvalley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to\r\nthe centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.\r\nThere was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even\r\nstilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken\r\nby no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and\r\nthis seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the\r\nmore profound. The boy\u2019s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings\r\nwere in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows\r\non his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him\r\nthat life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy\r\nHodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie\r\nand slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through\r\nthe trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and\r\nnothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a\r\nclean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with\r\nit all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant\r\nthe best in the world, and been treated like a dog\u2014like a very dog. She\r\nwould be sorry some day\u2014maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only\r\ndie _temporarily_!\r\n\r\nBut the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained\r\nshape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into\r\nthe concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and\r\ndisappeared mysteriously? What if he went away\u2014ever so far away, into\r\nunknown countries beyond the seas\u2014and never came back any more! How\r\nwould she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only\r\nto fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights\r\nwere an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was\r\nexalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be\r\na soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.\r\nNo\u2014better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on\r\nthe warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the\r\nFar West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with\r\nfeathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy\r\nsummer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs\r\nof all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was\r\nsomething gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!\r\n_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable\r\nsplendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!\r\nHow gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,\r\nblack-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying\r\nat the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear\r\nat the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in\r\nhis black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson\r\nsash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass\r\nat his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,\r\nwith the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy\r\nthe whisperings, \u201cIt\u2019s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!\u2014the Black Avenger of the\r\nSpanish Main!\u201d\r\n\r\nYes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from\r\nhome and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore\r\nhe must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.\r\nHe went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of\r\nit with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He\r\nput his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat hasn\u2019t come here, come! What\u2019s here, stay here!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it\r\nup and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides\r\nwere of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom\u2019s astonishment was boundless!\r\nHe scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that beats anything!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The\r\ntruth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and\r\nall his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried\r\na marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a\r\nfortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just\r\nused, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered\r\nthemselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been\r\nseparated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.\r\nTom\u2019s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had\r\nmany a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing\r\nbefore. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times\r\nbefore, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He\r\npuzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch\r\nhad interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself\r\non that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot\r\nwith a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and\r\nput his mouth close to this depression and called\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDoodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,\r\ndoodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a\r\nsecond and then darted under again in a fright.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe dasn\u2019t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he\r\ngave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have\r\nthe marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a\r\npatient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his\r\ntreasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing\r\nwhen he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his\r\npocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:\r\n\r\n\u201cBrother, go find your brother!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must\r\nhave fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last\r\nrepetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nJust here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green\r\naisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned\r\na suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,\r\ndisclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and\r\nin a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,\r\nwith fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an\r\nanswering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way\r\nand that. He said cautiously\u2014to an imaginary company:\r\n\r\n\u201cHold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.\r\nTom called:\r\n\r\n\u201cHold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGuy of Guisborne wants no man\u2019s pass. Who art thou that\u2014that\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDares to hold such language,\u201d said Tom, prompting\u2014for they talked \u201cby\r\nthe book,\u201d from memory.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho art thou that dares to hold such language?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute\r\nwith thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,\r\nstruck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful\r\ncombat, \u201ctwo up and two down.\u201d Presently Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, if you\u2019ve got the hang, go it lively!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they \u201cwent it lively,\u201d panting and perspiring with the work. By and\r\nby Tom shouted:\r\n\r\n\u201cFall! fall! Why don\u2019t you fall?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI sha\u2019n\u2019t! Why don\u2019t you fall yourself? You\u2019re getting the worst of\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that ain\u2019t anything. I can\u2019t fall; that ain\u2019t the way it is in the\r\nbook. The book says, \u2018Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy\r\nof Guisborne.\u2019 You\u2019re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the\r\nwhack and fell.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Joe, getting up, \u201cyou got to let me kill _you_. That\u2019s\r\nfair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I can\u2019t do that, it ain\u2019t in the book.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s blamed mean\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller\u2019s son, and lam\r\nme with a quarter-staff; or I\u2019ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be\r\nRobin Hood a little while and kill me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then\r\nTom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to\r\nbleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,\r\nrepresenting a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,\r\ngave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, \u201cWhere this arrow\r\nfalls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.\u201d Then he\r\nshot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle\r\nand sprang up too gaily for a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off\r\ngrieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern\r\ncivilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.\r\nThey said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than\r\nPresident of the United States forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.\r\nThey said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and\r\nwaited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be\r\nnearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He\r\nwould have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was\r\nafraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.\r\nEverything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,\r\nscarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking\r\nof the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack\r\nmysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.\r\nA measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly\u2019s chamber. And now the\r\ntiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,\r\nbegan. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the\r\nbed\u2019s head made Tom shudder\u2014it meant that somebody\u2019s days were numbered.\r\nThen the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered\r\nby a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last\r\nhe was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to\r\ndoze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear\r\nit. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most\r\nmelancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed\r\nhim. A cry of \u201cScat! you devil!\u201d and the crash of an empty bottle\r\nagainst the back of his aunt\u2019s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a\r\nsingle minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping\r\nalong the roof of the \u201cell\u201d on all fours. He \u201cmeow\u2019d\u201d with caution once\r\nor twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence\r\nto the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys\r\nmoved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they\r\nwere wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.\r\n\r\nIt was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,\r\nabout a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence\r\naround it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the\r\ntime, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the\r\nwhole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a\r\ntombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over\r\nthe graves, leaning for support and finding none. \u201cSacred to the memory\r\nof\u201d So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have\r\nbeen read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.\r\n\r\nA faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the\r\nspirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked\r\nlittle, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the\r\npervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the\r\nsharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the\r\nprotection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\nThen they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of\r\na distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom\u2019s\r\nreflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a\r\nwhisper:\r\n\r\n\u201cHucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?\u201d\r\n\r\nHuckleberry whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cI wisht I knowed. It\u2019s awful solemn like, _ain\u2019t_ it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter\r\ninwardly. Then Tom whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Hucky\u2014do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cO\u2019 course he does. Least his sperrit does.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom, after a pause:\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody\r\ncalls him Hoss.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA body can\u2019t be too partic\u2019lar how they talk \u2019bout these-yer dead\r\npeople, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\r\n\r\nPresently Tom seized his comrade\u2019s arm and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cSh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Tom?\u201d And the two clung together with beating hearts.\r\n\r\n\u201cSh! There \u2019tis again! Didn\u2019t you hear it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere! Now you hear it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord, Tom, they\u2019re coming! They\u2019re coming, sure. What\u2019ll we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dono. Think they\u2019ll see us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn\u2019t\r\ncome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be afeard. I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll bother us. We ain\u2019t doing\r\nany harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won\u2019t notice us at\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I\u2019m all of a shiver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cListen!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled\r\nsound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook! See there!\u201d whispered Tom. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an\r\nold-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable\r\nlittle spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a\r\nshudder:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the devils sure enough. Three of \u2019em! Lordy, Tom, we\u2019re goners!\r\nCan you pray?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try, but don\u2019t you be afeard. They ain\u2019t going to hurt us. \u2018Now I\r\nlay me down to sleep, I\u2014\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re _humans_! One of \u2019em is, anyway. One of \u2019em\u2019s old Muff Potter\u2019s\r\nvoice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014\u2019tain\u2019t so, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet I know it. Don\u2019t you stir nor budge. He ain\u2019t sharp enough to\r\nnotice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely\u2014blamed old rip!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll keep still. Now they\u2019re stuck. Can\u2019t find it. Here they\r\ncome again. Now they\u2019re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They\u2019re\r\np\u2019inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o\u2019 them voices; it\u2019s\r\nInjun Joe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so\u2014that murderin\u2019 half-breed! I\u2019d druther they was devils a dern\r\nsight. What kin they be up to?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the\r\ngrave and stood within a few feet of the boys\u2019 hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere it is,\u201d said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern\r\nup and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.\r\n\r\nPotter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple\r\nof shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.\r\nThe doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat\r\ndown with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the\r\nboys could have touched him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHurry, men!\u201d he said, in a low voice; \u201cthe moon might come out at any\r\nmoment.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no\r\nnoise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of\r\nmould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon\r\nthe coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two\r\nthe men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with\r\ntheir shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The\r\nmoon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.\r\nThe barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a\r\nblanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large\r\nspring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow the cussed thing\u2019s ready, Sawbones, and you\u2019ll just out with\r\nanother five, or here she stays.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the talk!\u201d said Injun Joe.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, what does this mean?\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou required your\r\npay in advance, and I\u2019ve paid you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and you done more than that,\u201d said Injun Joe, approaching the\r\ndoctor, who was now standing. \u201cFive years ago you drove me away from\r\nyour father\u2019s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to\r\neat, and you said I warn\u2019t there for any good; and when I swore I\u2019d get\r\neven with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for\r\na vagrant. Did you think I\u2019d forget? The Injun blood ain\u2019t in me for\r\nnothing. And now I\u2019ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.\r\nThe doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.\r\nPotter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, now, don\u2019t you hit my pard!\u201d and the next moment he had grappled\r\nwith the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,\r\ntrampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe\r\nsprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter\u2019s\r\nknife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about\r\nthe combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung\r\nhimself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams\u2019 grave and felled\r\nPotter to the earth with it\u2014and in the same instant the half-breed saw\r\nhis chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man\u2019s breast. He\r\nreeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in\r\nthe same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the\r\ntwo frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.\r\n\r\nPresently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the\r\ntwo forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave\r\na long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:\r\n\r\n\u201c_That_ score is settled\u2014damn you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter\u2019s\r\nopen right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three\u2014four\u2014five\r\nminutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed\r\nupon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a\r\nshudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and\r\nthen around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201cLord, how is this, Joe?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dirty business,\u201d said Joe, without moving.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you do it for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI! I never done it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here! That kind of talk won\u2019t wash.\u201d\r\n\r\nPotter trembled and grew white.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d got sober. I\u2019d no business to drink to-night. But it\u2019s\r\nin my head yet\u2014worse\u2019n when we started here. I\u2019m all in a muddle;\r\ncan\u2019t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe\u2014_honest_, now,\r\nold feller\u2014did I do it? Joe, I never meant to\u2014\u2019pon my soul and honor, I\r\nnever meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it\u2019s awful\u2014and him so\r\nyoung and promising.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard\r\nand you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering\r\nlike, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched\r\nyou another awful clip\u2014and here you\u2019ve laid, as dead as a wedge til\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I\r\ndid. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.\r\nI never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I\u2019ve fought, but never\r\nwith weepons. They\u2019ll all say that. Joe, don\u2019t tell! Say you won\u2019t tell,\r\nJoe\u2014that\u2019s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,\r\ntoo. Don\u2019t you remember? You _won\u2019t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?\u201d And the\r\npoor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and\r\nclasped his appealing hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I\r\nwon\u2019t go back on you. There, now, that\u2019s as fair as a man can say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Joe, you\u2019re an angel. I\u2019ll bless you for this the longest day I\r\nlive.\u201d And Potter began to cry.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, now, that\u2019s enough of that. This ain\u2019t any time for blubbering.\r\nYou be off yonder way and I\u2019ll go this. Move, now, and don\u2019t leave any\r\ntracks behind you.\u201d\r\n\r\nPotter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed\r\nstood looking after him. He muttered:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he\u2019s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he\r\nhad the look of being, he won\u2019t think of the knife till he\u2019s gone so\r\nfar he\u2019ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by\r\nhimself\u2014chicken-heart!\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the\r\nlidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the\r\nmoon\u2019s. The stillness was complete again, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with\r\nhorror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,\r\napprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump\r\nthat started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them\r\ncatch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay\r\nnear the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give\r\nwings to their feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!\u201d whispered\r\nTom, in short catches between breaths. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it much longer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuckleberry\u2019s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed\r\ntheir eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.\r\nThey gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst\r\nthrough the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering\r\nshadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuckleberry, what do you reckon\u2019ll come of this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging\u2019ll come of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you though?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I _know_ it, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom thought a while, then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019ll tell? We?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? S\u2019pose something happened and Injun Joe\r\n_didn\u2019t_ hang? Why, he\u2019d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure\r\nas we\u2019re a laying here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he\u2019s fool enough. He\u2019s\r\ngenerally drunk enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom said nothing\u2014went on thinking. Presently he whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, Muff Potter don\u2019t know it. How can he tell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason he don\u2019t know it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he\u2019d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D\u2019you reckon\r\nhe could see anything? D\u2019you reckon he knowed anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy hokey, that\u2019s so, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd besides, look-a-here\u2014maybe that whack done for _him_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, \u2019taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and\r\nbesides, he always has. Well, when pap\u2019s full, you might take and belt\r\nhim over the head with a church and you couldn\u2019t phase him. He says so,\r\nhis own self. So it\u2019s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man\r\nwas dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter another reflective silence, Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHucky, you sure you can keep mum?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn\u2019t\r\nmake any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak\r\n\u2019bout this and they didn\u2019t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take\r\nand swear to one another\u2014that\u2019s what we got to do\u2014swear to keep mum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m agreed. It\u2019s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear\r\nthat we\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, that wouldn\u2019t do for this. That\u2019s good enough for little\r\nrubbishy common things\u2014specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you\r\nanyway, and blab if they get in a huff\u2014but there orter be writing \u2019bout\r\na big thing like this. And blood.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom\u2019s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;\r\nthe hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.\r\nHe picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a\r\nlittle fragment of \u201cred keel\u201d out of his pocket, got the moon on\r\nhis work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow\r\ndown-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the\r\npressure on the up-strokes.\r\n\r\n  \u201cHuck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and\r\n   They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell\r\n   and Rot.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom\u2019s facility in writing, and\r\nthe sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and\r\nwas going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on! Don\u2019t do that. A pin\u2019s brass. It might have verdigrease on\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s verdigrease?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s p\u2019ison. That\u2019s what it is. You just swaller some of it once\u2014you\u2019ll\r\nsee.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked\r\nthe ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after\r\nmany squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his\r\nlittle finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and\r\nan F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the\r\nwall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters\r\nthat bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\nA figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined\r\nbuilding, now, but they did not notice it.\r\n\r\n\u201cTom,\u201d whispered Huckleberry, \u201cdoes this keep us from _ever_\r\ntelling\u2014_always_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it does. It don\u2019t make any difference _what_ happens, we got\r\nto keep mum. We\u2019d drop down dead\u2014don\u2019t _you_ know that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I reckon that\u2019s so.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up\r\na long, lugubrious howl just outside\u2014within ten feet of them. The boys\r\nclasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich of us does he mean?\u201d gasped Huckleberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cI dono\u2014peep through the crack. Quick!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, _you_, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t _do_ it, Huck!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, Tom. There \u2019tis again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, lordy, I\u2019m thankful!\u201d whispered Tom. \u201cI know his voice. It\u2019s Bull\r\nHarbison.\u201d *\r\n\r\n[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of\r\nhim as \u201cHarbison\u2019s Bull,\u201d but a son or a dog of that name was \u201cBull\r\nHarbison.\u201d]\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s good\u2014I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I\u2019d a bet\r\nanything it was a _stray_ dog.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dog howled again. The boys\u2019 hearts sank once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my! that ain\u2019t no Bull Harbison!\u201d whispered Huckleberry. \u201c_Do_,\r\nTom!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His\r\nwhisper was hardly audible when he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Huck, _it\u2019s a stray dog_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, he must mean us both\u2014we\u2019re right together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tom, I reckon we\u2019re goners. I reckon there ain\u2019t no mistake \u2019bout\r\nwhere _I\u2019ll_ go to. I been so wicked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a\r\nfeller\u2019s told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I\u2019d a\r\ntried\u2014but no, I wouldn\u2019t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,\r\nI lay I\u2019ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!\u201d And Tom began to snuffle a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\u201c_You_ bad!\u201d and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. \u201cConsound it, Tom\r\nSawyer, you\u2019re just old pie, \u2019long-side o\u2019 what I am. Oh, _lordy_,\r\nlordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom choked off and whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cLook, Hucky, look! He\u2019s got his _back_ to us!\u201d\r\n\r\nHucky looked, with joy in his heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you\r\nknow. _Now_ who can he mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.\r\n\r\n\u201cSh! What\u2019s that?\u201d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201cSounds like\u2014like hogs grunting. No\u2014it\u2019s somebody snoring, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat _is_ it! Where \u2019bouts is it, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bleeve it\u2019s down at \u2019tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep\r\nthere, sometimes, \u2019long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts\r\nthings when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain\u2019t ever coming back to\r\nthis town any more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys\u2019 souls once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cHucky, do you das\u2019t to go if I lead?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to, much. Tom, s\u2019pose it\u2019s Injun Joe!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the\r\nboys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their\r\nheels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,\r\nthe one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the\r\nsnorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man\r\nmoaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was\r\nMuff Potter. The boys\u2019 hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,\r\nwhen the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,\r\nthrough the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance\r\nto exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night\r\nair again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few\r\nfeet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose\r\npointing heavenward.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, geeminy, it\u2019s _him_!\u201d exclaimed both boys, in a breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Tom\u2014they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller\u2019s\r\nhouse, \u2019bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come\r\nin and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there\r\nain\u2019t anybody dead there yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I know that. And suppose there ain\u2019t. Didn\u2019t Gracie Miller fall\r\nin the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but she ain\u2019t _dead_. And what\u2019s more, she\u2019s getting better, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, you wait and see. She\u2019s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff\r\nPotter\u2019s a goner. That\u2019s what the niggers say, and they know all about\r\nthese kind of things, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window\r\nthe night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and\r\nfell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He\r\nwas not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the\r\nlight, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not\r\nbeen called\u2014persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled\r\nhim with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,\r\nfeeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had\r\nfinished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted\r\neyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill\r\nto the culprit\u2019s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it\r\nwas up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into\r\nsilence and let his heart sink down to the depths.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in\r\nthe hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt\r\nwept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;\r\nand finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs\r\nwith sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.\r\nThis was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom\u2019s heart was sorer now\r\nthan his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform\r\nover and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that\r\nhe had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nHe left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward\r\nSid; and so the latter\u2019s prompt retreat through the back gate was\r\nunnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,\r\nalong with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the\r\nair of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to\r\ntrifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his\r\ndesk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony\r\nstare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.\r\nHis elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time\r\nhe slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with\r\na sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal\r\nsigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!\r\n\r\nThis final feather broke the camel\u2019s back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nClose upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified\r\nwith the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;\r\nthe tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,\r\nwith little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave\r\nholiday for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of\r\nhim if he had not.\r\n\r\nA gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been\r\nrecognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter\u2014so the story ran. And\r\nit was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself\r\nin the \u201cbranch\u201d about one or two o\u2019clock in the morning, and that Potter\r\nhad at once sneaked off\u2014suspicious circumstances, especially the washing\r\nwhich was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had\r\nbeen ransacked for this \u201cmurderer\u201d (the public are not slow in the\r\nmatter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he\r\ncould not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every\r\ndirection, and the Sheriff \u201cwas confident\u201d that he would be captured\r\nbefore night.\r\n\r\nAll the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom\u2019s heartbreak\r\nvanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not\r\na thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,\r\nunaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he\r\nwormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.\r\nIt seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched\r\nhis arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry\u2019s. Then both looked\r\nelsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their\r\nmutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly\r\nspectacle before them.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d \u201cPoor young fellow!\u201d \u201cThis ought to be a lesson to grave\r\nrobbers!\u201d \u201cMuff Potter\u2019ll hang for this if they catch him!\u201d This was the\r\ndrift of remark; and the minister said, \u201cIt was a judgment; His hand is\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid\r\nface of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,\r\nand voices shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s him! it\u2019s him! he\u2019s coming himself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho? Who?\u201d from twenty voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cMuff Potter!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo, he\u2019s stopped!\u2014Look out, he\u2019s turning! Don\u2019t let him get away!\u201d\r\n\r\nPeople in the branches of the trees over Tom\u2019s head said he wasn\u2019t\r\ntrying to get away\u2014he only looked doubtful and perplexed.\r\n\r\n\u201cInfernal impudence!\u201d said a bystander; \u201cwanted to come and take a quiet\r\nlook at his work, I reckon\u2014didn\u2019t expect any company.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously\r\nleading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow\u2019s face was haggard, and\r\nhis eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the\r\nmurdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands\r\nand burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, friends,\u201d he sobbed; \u201c\u2019pon my word and honor I never\r\ndone it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s accused you?\u201d shouted a voice.\r\n\r\nThis shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around\r\nhim with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Injun Joe, you promised me you\u2019d never\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that your knife?\u201d and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.\r\n\r\nPotter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the\r\nground. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething told me \u2019t if I didn\u2019t come back and get\u2014\u201d He shuddered; then\r\nwaved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, \u201cTell \u2019em,\r\nJoe, tell \u2019em\u2014it ain\u2019t any use any more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the\r\nstony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every\r\nmoment that the clear sky would deliver God\u2019s lightnings upon his head,\r\nand wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had\r\nfinished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to\r\nbreak their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner\u2019s life faded and\r\nvanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and\r\nit would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leave? What did you want to come here for?\u201d somebody\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d Potter moaned. \u201cI wanted to\r\nrun away, but I couldn\u2019t seem to come anywhere but here.\u201d And he fell to\r\nsobbing again.\r\n\r\nInjun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes\r\nafterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the\r\nlightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that\r\nJoe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most\r\nbalefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could\r\nnot take their fascinated eyes from his face.\r\n\r\nThey inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should\r\noffer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.\r\n\r\nInjun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in\r\na wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering\r\ncrowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy\r\ncircumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were\r\ndisappointed, for more than one villager remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom\u2019s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as\r\nmuch as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me\r\nawake half the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom blanched and dropped his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d said Aunt Polly, gravely. \u201cWhat you got on your mind,\r\nTom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing. Nothing \u2019t I know of.\u201d But the boy\u2019s hand shook so that he\r\nspilled his coffee.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you do talk such stuff,\u201d Sid said. \u201cLast night you said, \u2018It\u2019s\r\nblood, it\u2019s blood, that\u2019s what it is!\u2019 You said that over and over.\r\nAnd you said, \u2018Don\u2019t torment me so\u2014I\u2019ll tell!\u2019 Tell _what_? What is it\r\nyou\u2019ll tell?\u201d\r\n\r\nEverything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have\r\nhappened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly\u2019s face\r\nand she came to Tom\u2019s relief without knowing it. She said:\r\n\r\n\u201cSho! It\u2019s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night\r\nmyself. Sometimes I dream it\u2019s me that done it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.\r\nTom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after\r\nthat he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every\r\nnight. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently\r\nslipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good\r\nwhile at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place\r\nagain. Tom\u2019s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew\r\nirksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of\r\nTom\u2019s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding\r\ninquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.\r\nSid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,\r\nthough it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;\r\nhe noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness\u2014and that was strange;\r\nand Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion\r\nto these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,\r\nbut said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and\r\nceased to torture Tom\u2019s conscience.\r\n\r\nEvery day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his\r\nopportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such\r\nsmall comforts through to the \u201cmurderer\u201d as he could get hold of. The\r\njail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge\r\nof the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it\r\nwas seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom\u2019s\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nThe villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride\r\nhim on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character\r\nthat nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the\r\nmatter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his\r\ninquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery\r\nthat preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in\r\nthe courts at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why Tom\u2019s mind had drifted away from its secret\r\ntroubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest\r\nitself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had\r\nstruggled with his pride a few days, and tried to \u201cwhistle her down the\r\nwind,\u201d but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father\u2019s\r\nhouse, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she\r\nshould die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an\r\ninterest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there\r\nwas nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;\r\nthere was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to\r\ntry all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who\r\nare infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of\r\nproducing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in\r\nthese things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a\r\nfever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,\r\nbut on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the\r\n\u201cHealth\u201d periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance\r\nthey were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the \u201crot\u201d they\r\ncontained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,\r\nand what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and\r\nwhat frame of mind to keep one\u2019s self in, and what sort of clothing\r\nto wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her\r\nhealth-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they\r\nhad recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest\r\nas the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered\r\ntogether her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed\r\nwith death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with\r\n\u201chell following after.\u201d But she never suspected that she was not an\r\nangel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe water treatment was new, now, and Tom\u2019s low condition was a windfall\r\nto her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the\r\nwood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed\r\nhim down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she\r\nrolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she\r\nsweated his soul clean and \u201cthe yellow stains of it came through his\r\npores\u201d\u2014as Tom said.\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and\r\npale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and\r\nplunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the\r\nwater with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his\r\ncapacity as she would a jug\u2019s, and filled him up every day with quack\r\ncure-alls.\r\n\r\nTom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase\r\nfilled the old lady\u2019s heart with consternation. This indifference must\r\nbe broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first\r\ntime. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with\r\ngratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water\r\ntreatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.\r\nShe gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the\r\nresult. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;\r\nfor the \u201cindifference\u201d was broken up. The boy could not have shown a\r\nwilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.\r\n\r\nTom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be\r\nromantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have\r\ntoo little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he\r\nthought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of\r\nprofessing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he\r\nbecame a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and\r\nquit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings\r\nto alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle\r\nclandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it\r\ndid not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in\r\nthe sitting-room floor with it.\r\n\r\nOne day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt\u2019s yellow\r\ncat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging\r\nfor a taste. Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Peter signified that he did want it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou better make sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nPeter was sure.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve asked for it, and I\u2019ll give it to you, because there ain\u2019t\r\nanything mean about me; but if you find you don\u2019t like it, you mustn\u2019t\r\nblame anybody but your own self.\u201d\r\n\r\nPeter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down\r\nthe Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then\r\ndelivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging\r\nagainst furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next\r\nhe rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,\r\nwith his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his\r\nunappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again\r\nspreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time\r\nto see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,\r\nand sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots\r\nwith him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over\r\nher glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, what on earth ails that cat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, aunt,\u201d gasped the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDeed I don\u2019t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they\u2019re having a\r\ngood time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey do, do they?\u201d There was something in the tone that made Tom\r\napprehensive.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2019m. That is, I believe they do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou _do_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized\r\nby anxiety. Too late he divined her \u201cdrift.\u201d The handle of the telltale\r\ntea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it\r\nup. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual\r\nhandle\u2014his ear\u2014and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI done it out of pity for him\u2014because he hadn\u2019t any aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHadn\u2019t any aunt!\u2014you numskull. What has that got to do with it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeaps. Because if he\u2019d had one she\u2019d a burnt him out herself! She\u2019d a\r\nroasted his bowels out of him \u2019thout any more feeling than if he was a\r\nhuman!\u201d\r\n\r\nAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in\r\na new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.\r\nShe began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she\r\nput her hand on Tom\u2019s head and said gently:\r\n\r\n\u201cI was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping\r\nthrough his gravity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It\r\ndone _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, go \u2019long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try\r\nand see if you can\u2019t be a good boy, for once, and you needn\u2019t take any\r\nmore medicine.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing\r\nhad been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,\r\nhe hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his\r\ncomrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to\r\nbe looking everywhere but whither he really was looking\u2014down the road.\r\nPresently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom\u2019s face lighted; he gazed\r\na moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom\r\naccosted him; and \u201cled up\u201d warily to opportunities for remark about\r\nBecky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and\r\nwatched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the\r\nowner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks\r\nceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered\r\nthe empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed\r\nin at the gate, and Tom\u2019s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he\r\nwas out, and \u201cgoing on\u201d like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,\r\njumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,\r\nstanding on his head\u2014doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,\r\nand keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher\r\nwas noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never\r\nlooked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?\r\nHe carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping\r\naround, snatched a boy\u2019s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,\r\nbroke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and\r\nfell sprawling, himself, under Becky\u2019s nose, almost upsetting her\u2014and\r\nshe turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: \u201cMf! some\r\npeople think they\u2019re mighty smart\u2014always showing off!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom\u2019s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and\r\ncrestfallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTom\u2019s mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a\r\nforsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out\r\nwhat they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried\r\nto do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing\r\nwould do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame\r\n_him_ for the consequences\u2014why shouldn\u2019t they? What right had the\r\nfriendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would\r\nlead a life of crime. There was no choice.\r\n\r\nBy this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to\r\n\u201ctake up\u201d tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he\r\nshould never, never hear that old familiar sound any more\u2014it was very\r\nhard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold\r\nworld, he must submit\u2014but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nJust at this point he met his soul\u2019s sworn comrade, Joe\r\nHarper\u2014hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his\r\nheart. Plainly here were \u201ctwo souls with but a single thought.\u201d Tom,\r\nwiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about\r\na resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by\r\nroaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping\r\nthat Joe would not forget him.\r\n\r\nBut it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going\r\nto make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother\r\nhad whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and\r\nknew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished\r\nhim to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but\r\nsuccumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her\r\npoor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.\r\n\r\nAs the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand\r\nby each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved\r\nthem of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for\r\nbeing a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,\r\nsome time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he\r\nconceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of\r\ncrime, and so he consented to be a pirate.\r\n\r\nThree miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River\r\nwas a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,\r\nwith a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a\r\nrendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further\r\nshore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson\u2019s\r\nIsland was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a\r\nmatter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,\r\nand he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was\r\nindifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the\r\nriver-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour\u2014which was\r\nmidnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.\r\nEach would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal\r\nin the most dark and mysterious way\u2014as became outlaws. And before the\r\nafternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of\r\nspreading the fact that pretty soon the town would \u201chear something.\u201d All\r\nwho got this vague hint were cautioned to \u201cbe mum and wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,\r\nand stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the\r\nmeeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay\r\nlike an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the\r\nquiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under\r\nthe bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the\r\nsame way. Then a guarded voice said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho goes there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.\u201d Tom\r\nhad furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tis well. Give the countersign.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the\r\nbrooding night:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Blood_!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,\r\ntearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was\r\nan easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked\r\nthe advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.\r\n\r\nThe Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn\r\nhimself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a\r\nskillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought\r\na few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or\r\n\u201cchewed\u201d but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it\r\nwould never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;\r\nmatches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering\r\nupon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily\r\nthither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing\r\nadventure of it, saying, \u201cHist!\u201d every now and then, and suddenly\r\nhalting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;\r\nand giving orders in dismal whispers that if \u201cthe foe\u201d stirred, to \u201clet\r\nhim have it to the hilt,\u201d because \u201cdead men tell no tales.\u201d They knew\r\nwell enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying\r\nin stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their\r\nconducting this thing in an unpiratical way.\r\n\r\nThey shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and\r\nJoe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded\r\narms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:\r\n\r\n\u201cLuff, and bring her to the wind!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSteady, steady-y-y-y!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSteady it is, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet her go off a point!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoint it is, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream\r\nit was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for\r\n\u201cstyle,\u201d and were not intended to mean anything in particular.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sail\u2019s she carrying?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCourses, tops\u2019ls, and flying-jib, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSend the r\u2019yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of\r\nye\u2014foretopmaststuns\u2019l! Lively, now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShake out that maintogalans\u2019l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHellum-a-lee\u2014hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,\r\nport! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSteady it is, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head\r\nright, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was\r\nnot more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during\r\nthe next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before\r\nthe distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,\r\npeacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,\r\nunconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black\r\nAvenger stood still with folded arms, \u201clooking his last\u201d upon the scene\r\nof his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing \u201cshe\u201d could see\r\nhim now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless\r\nheart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but\r\na small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson\u2019s Island beyond\r\neye-shot of the village, and so he \u201clooked his last\u201d with a broken and\r\nsatisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and\r\nthey all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift\r\nthem out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in\r\ntime, and made shift to avert it. About two o\u2019clock in the morning the\r\nraft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,\r\nand they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part\r\nof the little raft\u2019s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they\r\nspread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;\r\nbut they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as\r\nbecame outlaws.\r\n\r\nThey built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps\r\nwithin the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in\r\nthe frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn \u201cpone\u201d stock\r\nthey had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,\r\nfree way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,\r\nfar from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to\r\ncivilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy\r\nglare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the\r\nvarnished foliage and festooning vines.\r\n\r\nWhen the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance\r\nof corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,\r\nfilled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but\r\nthey would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting\r\ncampfire.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ain\u2019t_ it gay?\u201d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s _nuts_!\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhat would the boys say if they could see us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay? Well, they\u2019d just die to be here\u2014hey, Hucky!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon so,\u201d said Huckleberry; \u201canyways, I\u2019m suited. I don\u2019t want\r\nnothing better\u2019n this. I don\u2019t ever get enough to eat, gen\u2019ally\u2014and here\r\nthey can\u2019t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the life for me,\u201d said Tom. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get up,\r\nmornings, and you don\u2019t have to go to school, and wash, and all that\r\nblame foolishness. You see a pirate don\u2019t have to do _anything_, Joe,\r\nwhen he\u2019s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and\r\nthen he don\u2019t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, that\u2019s so,\u201d said Joe, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t thought much about it, you\r\nknow. I\u2019d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I\u2019ve tried it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Tom, \u201cpeople don\u2019t go much on hermits, nowadays, like\r\nthey used to in old times, but a pirate\u2019s always respected. And\r\na hermit\u2019s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put\r\nsackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?\u201d inquired Huck.\r\n\r\n\u201cI dono. But they\u2019ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You\u2019d have to do\r\nthat if you was a hermit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDern\u2019d if I would,\u201d said Huck.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what would you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dono. But I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Huck, you\u2019d _have_ to. How\u2019d you get around it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I just wouldn\u2019t stand it. I\u2019d run away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRun away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You\u2019d be\r\na disgrace.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished\r\ngouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with\r\ntobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of\r\nfragrant smoke\u2014he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The\r\nother pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to\r\nacquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does pirates have to do?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, they have just a bully time\u2014take ships and burn them, and get the\r\nmoney and bury it in awful places in their island where there\u2019s ghosts\r\nand things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships\u2014make \u2019em walk a\r\nplank.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they carry the women to the island,\u201d said Joe; \u201cthey don\u2019t kill the\r\nwomen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d assented Tom, \u201cthey don\u2019t kill the women\u2014they\u2019re too noble. And\r\nthe women\u2019s always beautiful, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver\r\nand di\u2019monds,\u201d said Joe, with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Huck.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the pirates.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon I ain\u2019t dressed fitten for a pirate,\u201d said he, with a\r\nregretful pathos in his voice; \u201cbut I ain\u2019t got none but these.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,\r\nafter they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand\r\nthat his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for\r\nwealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\r\n\r\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the\r\neyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the\r\nRed-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.\r\nThe Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had\r\nmore difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,\r\nand lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them\r\nkneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at\r\nall, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they\r\nmight call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at\r\nonce they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep\u2014but an\r\nintruder came, now, that would not \u201cdown.\u201d It was conscience. They began\r\nto feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and\r\nnext they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.\r\nThey tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had\r\npurloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not\r\nto be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the\r\nend, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking\r\nsweetmeats was only \u201chooking,\u201d while taking bacon and hams and such\r\nvaluables was plain simple stealing\u2014and there was a command against that\r\nin the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in\r\nthe business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the\r\ncrime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously\r\ninconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and\r\nrubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool\r\ngray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the\r\ndeep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not\r\na sound obtruded upon great Nature\u2019s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood\r\nupon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,\r\nand a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck\r\nstill slept.\r\n\r\nNow, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently\r\nthe hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray\r\nof the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life\r\nmanifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going\r\nto work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came\r\ncrawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air\r\nfrom time to time and \u201csniffing around,\u201d then proceeding again\u2014for he\r\nwas measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own\r\naccord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,\r\nby turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to\r\ngo elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its\r\ncurved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom\u2019s leg and\r\nbegan a journey over him, his whole heart was glad\u2014for that meant that\r\nhe was going to have a new suit of clothes\u2014without the shadow of a\r\ndoubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,\r\nfrom nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled\r\nmanfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,\r\nand lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed\r\nthe dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and\r\nsaid, \u201cLady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your\r\nchildren\u2019s alone,\u201d and she took wing and went off to see about it\u2014which\r\ndid not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was\r\ncredulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity\r\nmore than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and\r\nTom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body\r\nand pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A\r\ncatbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom\u2019s head, and trilled\r\nout her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then\r\na shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig\r\nalmost within the boy\u2019s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the\r\nstrangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow\r\nof the \u201cfox\u201d kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to\r\ninspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never\r\nseen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.\r\nAll Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight\r\npierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few\r\nbutterflies came fluttering upon the scene.\r\n\r\nTom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with\r\na shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and\r\ntumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white\r\nsandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the\r\ndistance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a\r\nslight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only\r\ngratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge\r\nbetween them and civilization.\r\n\r\nThey came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and\r\nravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a\r\nspring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak\r\nor hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood\r\ncharm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe\r\nwas slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a\r\nminute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in\r\ntheir lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time\r\nto get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,\r\na couple of sun-perch and a small catfish\u2014provisions enough for quite a\r\nfamily. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for\r\nno fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the\r\nquicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better\r\nhe is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,\r\nopen-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.\r\n\r\nThey lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,\r\nand then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They\r\ntramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,\r\namong solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the\r\nground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came\r\nupon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.\r\n\r\nThey found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be\r\nastonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles\r\nlong and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to\r\nwas only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards\r\nwide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle\r\nof the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to\r\nstop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw\r\nthemselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,\r\nand then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,\r\nand the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.\r\nThey fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This\r\ntook dim shape, presently\u2014it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the\r\nRed-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they\r\nwere all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak\r\nhis thought.\r\n\r\nFor some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar\r\nsound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a\r\nclock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound\r\nbecame more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,\r\nglanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There\r\nwas a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came\r\nfloating down out of the distance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it!\u201d exclaimed Joe, under his breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Tom in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tain\u2019t thunder,\u201d said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, \u201cbecuz thunder\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHark!\u201d said Tom. \u201cListen\u2014don\u2019t talk.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom\r\ntroubled the solemn hush.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and see.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They\r\nparted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little\r\nsteam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the\r\ncurrent. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great\r\nmany skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood\r\nof the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in\r\nthem were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the\r\nferryboat\u2019s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same\r\ndull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know now!\u201d exclaimed Tom; \u201csomebody\u2019s drownded!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d said Huck; \u201cthey done that last summer, when Bill Turner\r\ngot drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes\r\nhim come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put\r\nquicksilver in \u2019em and set \u2019em afloat, and wherever there\u2019s anybody\r\nthat\u2019s drownded, they\u2019ll float right there and stop.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard about that,\u201d said Joe. \u201cI wonder what makes the bread\r\ndo that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it ain\u2019t the bread, so much,\u201d said Tom; \u201cI reckon it\u2019s mostly what\r\nthey _say_ over it before they start it out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t say anything over it,\u201d said Huck. \u201cI\u2019ve seen \u2019em and\r\nthey don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s funny,\u201d said Tom. \u201cBut maybe they say it to themselves. Of\r\n_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because\r\nan ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not\r\nbe expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy jings, I wish I was over there, now,\u201d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do too,\u201d said Huck. \u201cI\u2019d give heaps to know who it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought\r\nflashed through Tom\u2019s mind, and he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201cBoys, I know who\u2019s drownded\u2014it\u2019s us!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they\r\nwere missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;\r\ntears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor\r\nlost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being\r\nindulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,\r\nand the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was\r\nconcerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.\r\n\r\nAs twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business\r\nand the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were\r\njubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble\r\nthey were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then\r\nfell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;\r\nand the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were\r\ngratifying to look upon\u2014from their point of view. But when the shadows\r\nof night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing\r\ninto the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The\r\nexcitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts\r\nof certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as\r\nmuch as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a\r\nsigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a\r\nroundabout \u201cfeeler\u201d as to how the others might look upon a return to\r\ncivilization\u2014not right now, but\u2014\r\n\r\nTom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined\r\nin with Tom, and the waverer quickly \u201cexplained,\u201d and was glad to get\r\nout of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness\r\nclinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to\r\nrest for the moment.\r\n\r\nAs the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.\r\nJoe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,\r\nwatching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,\r\nand went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung\r\nby the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders\r\nof the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed\r\nto suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something\r\nupon each of these with his \u201cred keel\u201d; one he rolled up and put in his\r\njacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe\u2019s hat and removed it to a\r\nlittle distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain\r\nschoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value\u2014among them a lump of\r\nchalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind\r\nof marbles known as a \u201csure \u2019nough crystal.\u201d Then he tiptoed his way\r\ncautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and\r\nstraightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward\r\nthe Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway\r\nover; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out\r\nconfidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering\r\nupstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had\r\nexpected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till\r\nhe found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket\r\npocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,\r\nfollowing the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten\r\no\u2019clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the\r\nferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything\r\nwas quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching\r\nwith all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes\r\nand climbed into the skiff that did \u201cyawl\u201d duty at the boat\u2019s stern. He\r\nlaid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\r\n\r\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to \u201ccast\r\noff.\u201d A minute or two later the skiff\u2019s head was standing high up,\r\nagainst the boat\u2019s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in\r\nhis success, for he knew it was the boat\u2019s last trip for the night. At\r\nthe end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and\r\nTom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards\r\ndownstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.\r\n\r\nHe flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his\r\naunt\u2019s back fence. He climbed over, approached the \u201cell,\u201d and looked\r\nin at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There\r\nsat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper\u2019s mother, grouped together,\r\ntalking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the\r\ndoor. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then\r\nhe pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing\r\ncautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might\r\nsqueeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,\r\nwarily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes the candle blow so?\u201d said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. \u201cWhy,\r\nthat door\u2019s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange\r\nthings now. Go \u2019long and shut it, Sid.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and \u201cbreathed\u201d\r\n himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his\r\naunt\u2019s foot.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut as I was saying,\u201d said Aunt Polly, \u201che warn\u2019t _bad_, so to say\u2014only\r\nmisch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn\u2019t\r\nany more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was\r\nthe best-hearted boy that ever was\u201d\u2014and she began to cry.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was just so with my Joe\u2014always full of his devilment, and up to\r\nevery kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he\r\ncould be\u2014and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking\r\nthat cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because\r\nit was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,\r\nnever, poor abused boy!\u201d And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope Tom\u2019s better off where he is,\u201d said Sid, \u201cbut if he\u2019d been\r\nbetter in some ways\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Sid!_\u201d Tom felt the glare of the old lady\u2019s eye, though he could not\r\nsee it. \u201cNot a word against my Tom, now that he\u2019s gone! God\u2019ll take care\r\nof _him_\u2014never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don\u2019t\r\nknow how to give him up! I don\u2019t know how to give him up! He was such a\r\ncomfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, \u2019most.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away\u2014Blessed be the name of\r\nthe Lord! But it\u2019s so hard\u2014Oh, it\u2019s so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe\r\nbusted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.\r\nLittle did I know then, how soon\u2014Oh, if it was to do over again I\u2019d hug\r\nhim and bless him for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just\r\nexactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took\r\nand filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would\r\ntear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom\u2019s head with my\r\nthimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he\u2019s out of all his troubles now.\r\nAnd the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely\r\ndown. Tom was snuffling, now, himself\u2014and more in pity of himself than\r\nanybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word\r\nfor him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself\r\nthan ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt\u2019s grief\r\nto long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy\u2014and\r\nthe theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his\r\nnature, too, but he resisted and lay still.\r\n\r\nHe went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was\r\nconjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;\r\nthen the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing\r\nlads had promised that the village should \u201chear something\u201d soon; the\r\nwise-heads had \u201cput this and that together\u201d and decided that the lads\r\nhad gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,\r\npresently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the\r\nMissouri shore some five or six miles below the village\u2014and then hope\r\nperished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home\r\nby nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the\r\nbodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must\r\nhave occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would\r\notherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies\r\ncontinued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the\r\nfunerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a\r\nmutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other\u2019s\r\narms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was\r\ntender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid\r\nsnuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.\r\n\r\nAunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,\r\nand with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,\r\nthat he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.\r\n\r\nHe had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making\r\nbroken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and\r\nturning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her\r\nsleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the\r\ncandle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full\r\nof pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the\r\ncandle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.\r\nHis face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark\r\nhastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and\r\nstraightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.\r\n\r\nHe threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large\r\nthere, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was\r\ntenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and\r\nslept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped\r\ninto it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a\r\nmile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself\r\nstoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for\r\nthis was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture\r\nthe skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore\r\nlegitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be\r\nmade for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and\r\nentered the woods.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep\r\nawake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far\r\nspent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the\r\nisland bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the\r\ngreat river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A\r\nlittle later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and\r\nheard Joe say:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Tom\u2019s true-blue, Huck, and he\u2019ll come back. He won\u2019t desert. He\r\nknows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom\u2019s too proud for that\r\nsort of thing. He\u2019s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the things is ours, anyway, ain\u2019t they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain\u2019t\r\nback here to breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich he is!\u201d exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping\r\ngrandly into camp.\r\n\r\nA sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the\r\nboys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.\r\nThey were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.\r\nThen Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the\r\nother pirates got ready to fish and explore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.\r\nThey went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft\r\nplace they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes\r\nthey would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly\r\nround white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a\r\nfamous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and\r\nchased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until\r\nthey were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal\r\nwater of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their\r\nlegs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.\r\nAnd now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each\r\nother\u2019s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with\r\naverted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and\r\nstruggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all\r\nwent under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,\r\nsputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,\r\nhot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by\r\nbreak for the water again and go through the original performance once\r\nmore. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented\r\nflesh-colored \u201ctights\u201d very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and\r\nhad a circus\u2014with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest\r\npost to his neighbor.\r\n\r\nNext they got their marbles and played \u201cknucks\u201d and \u201cringtaw\u201d and\r\n\u201ckeeps\u201d till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another\r\nswim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off\r\nhis trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his\r\nankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the\r\nprotection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he\r\nhad found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to\r\nrest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the \u201cdumps,\u201d and\r\nfell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay\r\ndrowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing \u201cBECKY\u201d in the sand with\r\nhis big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his\r\nweakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He\r\nerased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving\r\nthe other boys together and joining them.\r\n\r\nBut Joe\u2019s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so\r\nhomesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay\r\nvery near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,\r\nbut tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready\r\nto tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he\r\nwould have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet there\u2019s been pirates on this island before, boys. We\u2019ll explore\r\nit again. They\u2019ve hid treasures here somewhere. How\u2019d you feel to light\r\non a rotten chest full of gold and silver\u2014hey?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.\r\nTom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was\r\ndiscouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking\r\nvery gloomy. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, boys, let\u2019s give it up. I want to go home. It\u2019s so lonesome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, Joe, you\u2019ll feel better by and by,\u201d said Tom. \u201cJust think of the\r\nfishing that\u2019s here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for fishing. I want to go home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Joe, there ain\u2019t such another swimming-place anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSwimming\u2019s no good. I don\u2019t seem to care for it, somehow, when there\r\nain\u2019t anybody to say I sha\u2019n\u2019t go in. I mean to go home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I _do_ want to see my mother\u2014and you would, too, if you had one. I\r\nain\u2019t any more baby than you are.\u201d And Joe snuffled a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won\u2019t we, Huck? Poor\r\nthing\u2014does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,\r\ndon\u2019t you, Huck? We\u2019ll stay, won\u2019t we?\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck said, \u201cY-e-s\u201d\u2014without any heart in it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll never speak to you again as long as I live,\u201d said Joe, rising.\r\n\u201cThere now!\u201d And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho cares!\u201d said Tom. \u201cNobody wants you to. Go \u2019long home and get\r\nlaughed at. Oh, you\u2019re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain\u2019t crybabies. We\u2019ll\r\nstay, won\u2019t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get\r\nalong without him, per\u2019aps.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly\r\non with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying\r\nJoe\u2019s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.\r\nPresently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the\r\nIllinois shore. Tom\u2019s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck\r\ncould not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now\r\nit\u2019ll be worse. Let\u2019s us go, too, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, I better go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, go \u2019long\u2014who\u2019s hendering you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, I wisht you\u2019d come, too. Now you think it over. We\u2019ll wait for you\r\nwhen we get to shore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll wait a blame long time, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a\r\nstrong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along\r\ntoo. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It\r\nsuddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made\r\none final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,\r\nyelling:\r\n\r\n\u201cWait! Wait! I want to tell you something!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they\r\nwere, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till\r\nat last they saw the \u201cpoint\u201d he was driving at, and then they set up a\r\nwarwhoop of applause and said it was \u201csplendid!\u201d and said if he had\r\ntold them at first, they wouldn\u2019t have started away. He made a plausible\r\nexcuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret\r\nwould keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had\r\nmeant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.\r\n\r\nThe lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,\r\nchattering all the time about Tom\u2019s stupendous plan and admiring the\r\ngenius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to\r\nlearn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to\r\ntry, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never\r\nsmoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they \u201cbit\u201d the\r\ntongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\r\n\r\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,\r\ncharily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,\r\nand they gagged a little, but Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s just as easy! If I\u2019d a knowed this was all, I\u2019d a learnt long\r\nago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo would I,\u201d said Joe. \u201cIt\u2019s just nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, many a time I\u2019ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish\r\nI could do that; but I never thought I could,\u201d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way with me, hain\u2019t it, Huck? You\u2019ve heard me talk just\r\nthat way\u2014haven\u2019t you, Huck? I\u2019ll leave it to Huck if I haven\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014heaps of times,\u201d said Huck.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have too,\u201d said Tom; \u201coh, hundreds of times. Once down by the\r\nslaughter-house. Don\u2019t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and\r\nJohnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don\u2019t you remember,\r\nHuck, \u2019bout me saying that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s so,\u201d said Huck. \u201cThat was the day after I lost a white\r\nalley. No, \u2019twas the day before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2014I told you so,\u201d said Tom. \u201cHuck recollects it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,\u201d said Joe. \u201cI don\u2019t feel\r\nsick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff\r\nThatcher couldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJeff Thatcher! Why, he\u2019d keel over just with two draws. Just let him\r\ntry it once. _He\u2019d_ see!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet he would. And Johnny Miller\u2014I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle\r\nit once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t I!\u201d said Joe. \u201cWhy, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn\u2019t any more\r\ndo this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Deed it would, Joe. Say\u2014I wish the boys could see us now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay\u2014boys, don\u2019t say anything about it, and some time when they\u2019re\r\naround, I\u2019ll come up to you and say, \u2018Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.\u2019\r\nAnd you\u2019ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn\u2019t anything, you\u2019ll\r\nsay, \u2018Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain\u2019t\r\nvery good.\u2019 And I\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s all right, if it\u2019s _strong_\r\nenough.\u2019 And then you\u2019ll out with the pipes, and we\u2019ll light up just as\r\nca\u2019m, and then just see \u2019em look!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy jings, that\u2019ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I! And when we tell \u2019em we learned when we was off pirating,\r\nwon\u2019t they wish they\u2019d been along?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I reckon not! I\u2019ll just _bet_ they will!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and\r\ngrow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously\r\nincreased. Every pore inside the boys\u2019 cheeks became a spouting\r\nfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\r\nfast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their\r\nthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\r\nfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,\r\nnow. Joe\u2019s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom\u2019s followed. Both\r\nfountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and\r\nmain. Joe said feebly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you. You go over that way and I\u2019ll hunt around by the spring.\r\nNo, you needn\u2019t come, Huck\u2014we can find it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,\r\nand went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both\r\nvery pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had\r\nhad any trouble they had got rid of it.\r\n\r\nThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\r\nand when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\r\ntheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well\u2014something they ate\r\nat dinner had disagreed with them.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding\r\noppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys\r\nhuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of\r\nthe fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was\r\nstifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.\r\nBeyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the\r\nblackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that\r\nvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by\r\nanother came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came\r\nsighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting\r\nbreath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit\r\nof the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned\r\nnight into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and\r\ndistinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,\r\nstartled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling\r\ndown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A\r\nsweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the\r\nflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the\r\nforest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops\r\nright over the boys\u2019 heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick\r\ngloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick! boys, go for the tent!\u201d exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\nThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no\r\ntwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through\r\nthe trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after\r\nanother came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching\r\nrain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the\r\nground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the\r\nbooming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one\r\nthey straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,\r\nand streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something\r\nto be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so\r\nfuriously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest\r\nrose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its\r\nfastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each\r\nothers\u2019 hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter\r\nof a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its\r\nhighest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed\r\nin the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless\r\ndistinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the\r\ndriving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on\r\nthe other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting\r\nveil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight\r\nand fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging\r\nthunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,\r\nand unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort\r\nthat seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to\r\nthe treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one\r\nand the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be\r\nout in.\r\n\r\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and\r\nweaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The\r\nboys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still\r\nsomething to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter\r\nof their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were\r\nnot under it when the catastrophe happened.\r\n\r\nEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but\r\nheedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against\r\nrain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and\r\nchilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently\r\ndiscovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had\r\nbeen built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from\r\nthe ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they\r\npatiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under\r\nsides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they\r\npiled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were\r\ngladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,\r\nand after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their\r\nmidnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep\r\non, anywhere around.\r\n\r\nAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over\r\nthem, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got\r\nscorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After\r\nthe meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once\r\nmore. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as\r\nhe could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or\r\nanything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of\r\ncheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was\r\nto knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.\r\nThey were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were\r\nstripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many\r\nzebras\u2014all of them chiefs, of course\u2014and then they went tearing through\r\nthe woods to attack an English settlement.\r\n\r\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each\r\nother from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each\r\nother by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely\r\nsatisfactory one.\r\n\r\nThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now\r\na difficulty arose\u2014hostile Indians could not break the bread of\r\nhospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple\r\nimpossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other\r\nprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished\r\nthey had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such\r\nshow of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and\r\ntook their whiff as it passed, in due form.\r\n\r\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had\r\ngained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without\r\nhaving to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to\r\nbe seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high\r\npromise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,\r\nwith right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were\r\nprouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been\r\nin the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to\r\nsmoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday\r\nafternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly\u2019s family, were being put into\r\nmourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed\r\nthe village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.\r\nThe villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked\r\nlittle; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to\r\nthe children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted\r\nschoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing\r\nthere to comfort her. She soliloquized:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven\u2019t got\r\nanything now to remember him by.\u201d And she choked back a little sob.\r\n\r\nPresently she stopped, and said to herself:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn\u2019t say\r\nthat\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say it for the whole world. But he\u2019s gone now; I\u2019ll\r\nnever, never, never see him any more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling\r\ndown her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls\u2014playmates of Tom\u2019s\r\nand Joe\u2019s\u2014came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking\r\nin reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw\r\nhim, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful\r\nprophecy, as they could easily see now!)\u2014and each speaker pointed out\r\nthe exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added\r\nsomething like \u201cand I was a-standing just so\u2014just as I am now, and as if\r\nyou was him\u2014I was as close as that\u2014and he smiled, just this way\u2014and then\r\nsomething seemed to go all over me, like\u2014awful, you know\u2014and I never\r\nthought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and\r\nmany claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or\r\nless tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided\r\nwho _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,\r\nthe lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,\r\nand were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had\r\nno other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the\r\nremembrance:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,\r\nand so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,\r\nstill recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell\r\nbegan to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still\r\nSabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush\r\nthat lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment\r\nin the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there\r\nwas no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses\r\nas the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None\r\ncould remember when the little church had been so full before. There\r\nwas finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly\r\nentered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in\r\ndeep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose\r\nreverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.\r\nThere was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled\r\nsobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving\r\nhymn was sung, and the text followed: \u201cI am the Resurrection and the\r\nLife.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the\r\ngraces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that\r\nevery soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang\r\nin remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always\r\nbefore, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor\r\nboys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the\r\ndeparted, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the\r\npeople could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes\r\nwere, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had\r\nseemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation\r\nbecame more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last\r\nthe whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus\r\nof anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and\r\ncrying in the pulpit.\r\n\r\nThere was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later\r\nthe church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above\r\nhis handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair\r\nof eyes followed the minister\u2019s, and then almost with one impulse the\r\ncongregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up\r\nthe aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,\r\nsneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery\r\nlistening to their own funeral sermon!\r\n\r\nAunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored\r\nones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while\r\npoor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what\r\nto do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and\r\nstarted to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cAunt Polly, it ain\u2019t fair. Somebody\u2019s got to be glad to see Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so they shall. I\u2019m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!\u201d And\r\nthe loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing\r\ncapable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: \u201cPraise God from\r\nwhom all blessings flow\u2014_sing_!\u2014and put your hearts in it!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and\r\nwhile it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the\r\nenvying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the\r\nproudest moment of his life.\r\n\r\nAs the \u201csold\u201d congregation trooped out they said they would almost be\r\nwilling to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nTom got more cuffs and kisses that day\u2014according to Aunt Polly\u2019s varying\r\nmoods\u2014than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which\r\nexpressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was Tom\u2019s great secret\u2014the scheme to return home with his brother\r\npirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the\r\nMissouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles\r\nbelow the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town\r\ntill nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys\r\nand finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of\r\ninvalided benches.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to\r\nTom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of\r\ntalk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody\r\nsuffering \u2019most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you\r\ncould be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over\r\non a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a\r\nhint some way that you warn\u2019t dead, but only run off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you could have done that, Tom,\u201d said Mary; \u201cand I believe you\r\nwould if you had thought of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you, Tom?\u201d said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. \u201cSay,\r\nnow, would you, if you\u2019d thought of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014well, I don\u2019t know. \u2019Twould \u2019a\u2019 spoiled everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, I hoped you loved me that much,\u201d said Aunt Polly, with a grieved\r\ntone that discomforted the boy. \u201cIt would have been something if you\u2019d\r\ncared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn\u2019t _do_ it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, auntie, that ain\u2019t any harm,\u201d pleaded Mary; \u201cit\u2019s only Tom\u2019s giddy\r\nway\u2014he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore\u2019s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and\r\n_done_ it, too. Tom, you\u2019ll look back, some day, when it\u2019s too late,\r\nand wish you\u2019d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so\r\nlittle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, auntie, you know I do care for you,\u201d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d know it better if you acted more like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish now I\u2019d thought,\u201d said Tom, with a repentant tone; \u201cbut I dreamt\r\nabout you, anyway. That\u2019s something, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t much\u2014a cat does that much\u2014but it\u2019s better than nothing. What\r\ndid you dream?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the\r\nbed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, so we did. So we always do. I\u2019m glad your dreams could take even\r\nthat much trouble about us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I dreamt that Joe Harper\u2019s mother was here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, she was here! Did you dream any more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, lots. But it\u2019s so dim, now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, try to recollect\u2014can\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomehow it seems to me that the wind\u2014the wind blowed the\u2014the\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTry harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it now! I\u2019ve got it now! It blowed the candle!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy on us! Go on, Tom\u2014go on!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it seems to me that you said, \u2018Why, I believe that that door\u2014\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo _on_, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust let me study a moment\u2014just a moment. Oh, yes\u2014you said you believed\r\nthe door was open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I\u2019m sitting here, I did! Didn\u2019t I, Mary! Go on!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then\u2014and then\u2014well I won\u2019t be certain, but it seems like as if you\r\nmade Sid go and\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou made him\u2014you\u2014Oh, you made him shut it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, for the land\u2019s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my\r\ndays! Don\u2019t tell _me_ there ain\u2019t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny\r\nHarper shall know of this before I\u2019m an hour older. I\u2019d like to see her\r\nget around _this_ with her rubbage \u2019bout superstition. Go on, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn\u2019t\r\n_bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible\r\nthan\u2014than\u2014I think it was a colt, or something.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then you began to cry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and\r\nshe wished she hadn\u2019t whipped him for taking cream when she\u2019d throwed it\r\nout her own self\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying\u2014that\u2019s what you\r\nwas doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen Sid he said\u2014he said\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I said anything,\u201d said Sid.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes you did, Sid,\u201d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\u201cShut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said\u2014I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone\r\nto, but if I\u2019d been better sometimes\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_There_, d\u2019you hear that! It was his very words!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you shut him up sharp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI lay I did! There must \u2019a\u2019 been an angel there. There _was_ an angel\r\nthere, somewheres!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you\r\ntold about Peter and the Pain-killer\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as true as I live!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then there was a whole lot of talk \u2019bout dragging the river for us,\r\nand \u2019bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper\r\nhugged and cried, and she went.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I\u2019m a-sitting in\r\nthese very tracks. Tom, you couldn\u2019t told it more like if you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 seen\r\nit! And then what? Go on, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I thought you prayed for me\u2014and I could see you and hear every\r\nword you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and\r\nwrote on a piece of sycamore bark, \u2018We ain\u2019t dead\u2014we are only off being\r\npirates,\u2019 and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked\r\nso good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and\r\nkissed you on the lips.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that!\u201d And\r\nshe seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the\r\nguiltiest of villains.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very kind, even though it was only a\u2014dream,\u201d Sid soliloquized\r\njust audibly.\r\n\r\n\u201cShut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he\u2019d do if he was\r\nawake. Here\u2019s a big Milum apple I\u2019ve been saving for you, Tom, if you\r\nwas ever found again\u2014now go \u2019long to school. I\u2019m thankful to the good\r\nGod and Father of us all I\u2019ve got you back, that\u2019s long-suffering and\r\nmerciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness\r\nknows I\u2019m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings\r\nand had His hand to help them over the rough places, there\u2019s few enough\r\nwould smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.\r\nGo \u2019long Sid, Mary, Tom\u2014take yourselves off\u2014you\u2019ve hendered me long\r\nenough.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper\r\nand vanquish her realism with Tom\u2019s marvellous dream. Sid had better\r\njudgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the\r\nhouse. It was this: \u201cPretty thin\u2014as long a dream as that, without any\r\nmistakes in it!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,\r\nbut moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the\r\npublic eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see\r\nthe looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and\r\ndrink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud\r\nto be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer\r\nat the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into\r\ntown. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at\r\nall; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have\r\ngiven anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his\r\nglittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a\r\ncircus.\r\n\r\nAt school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered\r\nsuch eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were\r\nnot long in becoming insufferably \u201cstuck-up.\u201d They began to tell their\r\nadventures to hungry listeners\u2014but they only began; it was not a\r\nthing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish\r\nmaterial. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely\r\npuffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.\r\n\r\nTom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory\r\nwas sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,\r\nmaybe she would be wanting to \u201cmake up.\u201d Well, let her\u2014she should see\r\nthat he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she\r\narrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group\r\nof boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was\r\ntripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,\r\npretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter\r\nwhen she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her\r\ncaptures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye\r\nin his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity\r\nthat was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only \u201cset him up\u201d\r\n the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he\r\nknew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved\r\nirresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and\r\nwistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more\r\nparticularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang\r\nand grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her\r\nfeet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to\r\na girl almost at Tom\u2019s elbow\u2014with sham vivacity:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn\u2019t you come to Sunday-school?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did come\u2014didn\u2019t you see me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, no! Did you? Where did you sit?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was in Miss Peters\u2019 class, where I always go. I saw _you_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you? Why, it\u2019s funny I didn\u2019t see you. I wanted to tell you about\r\nthe picnic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s jolly. Who\u2019s going to give it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy ma\u2019s going to let me have one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, goody; I hope she\u2019ll let _me_ come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she will. The picnic\u2019s for me. She\u2019ll let anybody come that I\r\nwant, and I want you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ever so nice. When is it going to be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy and by. Maybe about vacation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, won\u2019t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, every one that\u2019s friends to me\u2014or wants to be\u201d; and she glanced\r\never so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence\r\nabout the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the\r\ngreat sycamore tree \u201call to flinders\u201d while he was \u201cstanding within\r\nthree feet of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, may I come?\u201d said Grace Miller.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd me?\u201d said Sally Rogers.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd me, too?\u201d said Susy Harper. \u201cAnd Joe?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged\r\nfor invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still\r\ntalking, and took Amy with him. Becky\u2019s lips trembled and the tears\r\ncame to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on\r\nchattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of\r\neverything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and\r\nhad what her sex call \u201ca good cry.\u201d Then she sat moody, with wounded\r\npride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast\r\nin her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what\r\n_she\u2019d_ do.\r\n\r\nAt recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant\r\nself-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate\r\nher with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden\r\nfalling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind\r\nthe schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple\u2014and so\r\nabsorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,\r\nthat they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.\r\nJealousy ran red-hot through Tom\u2019s veins. He began to hate himself for\r\nthrowing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He\r\ncalled himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He\r\nwanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,\r\nfor her heart was singing, but Tom\u2019s tongue had lost its function. He\r\ndid not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly\r\nhe could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced\r\nas otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and\r\nagain, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could\r\nnot help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that\r\nBecky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the\r\nliving. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her\r\nfight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\r\n\r\nAmy\u2019s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had\r\nto attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in\r\nvain\u2014the girl chirped on. Tom thought, \u201cOh, hang her, ain\u2019t I ever going\r\nto get rid of her?\u201d At last he must be attending to those things\u2014and she\r\nsaid artlessly that she would be \u201caround\u201d when school let out. And he\r\nhastened away, hating her for it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny other boy!\u201d Tom thought, grating his teeth. \u201cAny boy in the whole\r\ntown but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is\r\naristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this\r\ntown, mister, and I\u2019ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you\r\nout! I\u2019ll just take and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy\u2014pummelling\r\nthe air, and kicking and gouging. \u201cOh, you do, do you? You holler\r\n\u2019nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!\u201d And so the imaginary\r\nflogging was finished to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\nTom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy\u2019s\r\ngrateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other\r\ndistress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the\r\nminutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to\r\ncloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,\r\nand then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at\r\na footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew\r\nentirely miserable and wished she hadn\u2019t carried it so far. When\r\npoor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept\r\nexclaiming: \u201cOh, here\u2019s a jolly one! look at this!\u201d she lost patience at\r\nlast, and said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t bother me! I don\u2019t care for them!\u201d and burst\r\ninto tears, and got up and walked away.\r\n\r\nAlfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cGo away and leave me alone, can\u2019t you! I hate you!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the boy halted, wondering what he could have done\u2014for she had said\r\nshe would look at pictures all through the nooning\u2014and she walked on,\r\ncrying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was\r\nhumiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth\u2014the girl\r\nhad simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.\r\nHe was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.\r\nHe wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much\r\nrisk to himself. Tom\u2019s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his\r\nopportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and\r\npoured ink upon the page.\r\n\r\nBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,\r\nand moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,\r\nintending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their\r\ntroubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she\r\nhad changed her mind. The thought of Tom\u2019s treatment of her when she was\r\ntalking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.\r\nShe resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book\u2019s\r\naccount, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTom arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said\r\nto him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising\r\nmarket:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, I\u2019ve a notion to skin you alive!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAuntie, what have I done?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old\r\nsofty, expecting I\u2019m going to make her believe all that rubbage about\r\nthat dream, when lo and behold you she\u2019d found out from Joe that you was\r\nover here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don\u2019t know\r\nwhat is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so\r\nbad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool\r\nof myself and never say a word.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had\r\nseemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked\r\nmean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to\r\nsay for a moment. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cAuntie, I wish I hadn\u2019t done it\u2014but I didn\u2019t think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your\r\nown selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from\r\nJackson\u2019s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could\r\nthink to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn\u2019t ever think\r\nto pity us and save us from sorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAuntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn\u2019t mean to be mean. I didn\u2019t,\r\nhonest. And besides, I didn\u2019t come over here to laugh at you that\r\nnight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you come for, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn\u2019t got\r\ndrownded.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could\r\nbelieve you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never\r\ndid\u2014and I know it, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed and \u2019deed I did, auntie\u2014I wish I may never stir if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tom, don\u2019t lie\u2014don\u2019t do it. It only makes things a hundred times\r\nworse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t a lie, auntie; it\u2019s the truth. I wanted to keep you from\r\ngrieving\u2014that was all that made me come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d give the whole world to believe that\u2014it would cover up a power\r\nof sins, Tom. I\u2019d \u2019most be glad you\u2019d run off and acted so bad. But it\r\nain\u2019t reasonable; because, why didn\u2019t you tell me, child?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all\r\nfull of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn\u2019t\r\nsomehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and\r\nkept mum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat bark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe bark I had wrote on to tell you we\u2019d gone pirating. I wish, now,\r\nyou\u2019d waked up when I kissed you\u2014I do, honest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hard lines in his aunt\u2019s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned\r\nin her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes, I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure you did, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes, I did, auntie\u2014certain sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you kiss me for, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in\r\nher voice when she said:\r\n\r\n\u201cKiss me again, Tom!\u2014and be off with you to school, now, and don\u2019t\r\nbother me any more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a\r\njacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her\r\nhand, and said to herself:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he\u2019s lied about it\u2014but it\u2019s a\r\nblessed, blessed lie, there\u2019s such a comfort come from it. I hope\r\nthe Lord\u2014I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such\r\ngood-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don\u2019t want to find out it\u2019s a\r\nlie. I won\u2019t look.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out\r\nher hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more\r\nshe ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good lie\u2014it\u2019s a good lie\u2014I won\u2019t let it grieve me.\u201d So she\r\nsought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom\u2019s piece of\r\nbark through flowing tears and saying: \u201cI could forgive the boy, now, if\r\nhe\u2019d committed a million sins!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was something about Aunt Polly\u2019s manner, when she kissed Tom, that\r\nswept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He\r\nstarted to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the\r\nhead of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a\r\nmoment\u2019s hesitation he ran to her and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I\u2019m so sorry. I won\u2019t ever, ever\r\ndo that way again, as long as ever I live\u2014please make up, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I\u2019ll\r\nnever speak to you again.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not\r\neven presence of mind enough to say \u201cWho cares, Miss Smarty?\u201d until the\r\nright time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a\r\nfine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were\r\na boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently\r\nencountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled\r\none in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in\r\nher hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to \u201ctake in,\u201d\r\n she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.\r\nIf she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom\u2019s\r\noffensive fling had driven it entirely away.\r\n\r\nPoor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.\r\nThe master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied\r\nambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but\r\npoverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village\r\nschoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and\r\nabsorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept\r\nthat book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was\r\nperishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy\r\nand girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories\r\nwere alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.\r\nNow, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she\r\nnoticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She\r\nglanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the\r\nbook in her hands. The titlepage\u2014Professor Somebody\u2019s _Anatomy_\u2014carried\r\nno information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at\r\nonce upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece\u2014a human figure,\r\nstark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer\r\nstepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky\r\nsnatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the\r\npictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,\r\nturned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.\r\n\r\n\u201cTom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person\r\nand look at what they\u2019re looking at.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could I know you was looking at anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you\u2019re\r\ngoing to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I\u2019ll be\r\nwhipped, and I never was whipped in school.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she stamped her little foot and said:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that\u2019s going to happen.\r\nYou just wait and you\u2019ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!\u201d\u2014and she flung\r\nout of the house with a new explosion of crying.\r\n\r\nTom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said\r\nto himself:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in\r\nschool! Shucks! What\u2019s a licking! That\u2019s just like a girl\u2014they\u2019re so\r\nthin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain\u2019t going to tell\r\nold Dobbins on this little fool, because there\u2019s other ways of getting\r\neven on her, that ain\u2019t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask\r\nwho it was tore his book. Nobody\u2019ll answer. Then he\u2019ll do just the way\r\nhe always does\u2014ask first one and then t\u2019other, and when he comes to the\r\nright girl he\u2019ll know it, without any telling. Girls\u2019 faces always tell\r\non them. They ain\u2019t got any backbone. She\u2019ll get licked. Well, it\u2019s a\r\nkind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain\u2019t any way\r\nout of it.\u201d Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: \u201cAll\r\nright, though; she\u2019d like to see me in just such a fix\u2014let her sweat it\r\nout!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the\r\nmaster arrived and school \u201ctook in.\u201d Tom did not feel a strong interest\r\nin his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls\u2019 side of the\r\nroom Becky\u2019s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want\r\nto pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get\r\nup no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the\r\nspelling-book discovery was made, and Tom\u2019s mind was entirely full\r\nof his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her\r\nlethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She\r\ndid not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he\r\nspilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only\r\nseemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad\r\nof that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she\r\nwas not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse\r\nto get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced\r\nherself to keep still\u2014because, said she to herself, \u201che\u2019ll tell about me\r\ntearing the picture sure. I wouldn\u2019t say a word, not to save his life!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all\r\nbroken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly\r\nupset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout\u2014he\r\nhad denied it for form\u2019s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck\r\nto the denial from principle.\r\n\r\nA whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air\r\nwas drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened\r\nhimself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,\r\nbut seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the\r\npupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched\r\nhis movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently\r\nfor a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!\r\nTom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit\r\nlook as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot\r\nhis quarrel with her. Quick\u2014something must be done! done in a flash,\r\ntoo! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.\r\nGood!\u2014he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring\r\nthrough the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little\r\ninstant, and the chance was lost\u2014the master opened the volume. If Tom\r\nonly had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help\r\nfor Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.\r\nEvery eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even\r\nthe innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten\u2014the\r\nmaster was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: \u201cWho tore this book?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness\r\ncontinued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\r\n\r\n\u201cBenjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?\u201d\r\n\r\nA denial. Another pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cJoseph Harper, did you?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother denial. Tom\u2019s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the\r\nslow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of\r\nboys\u2014considered a while, then turned to the girls:\r\n\r\n\u201cAmy Lawrence?\u201d\r\n\r\nA shake of the head.\r\n\r\n\u201cGracie Miller?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe same sign.\r\n\r\n\u201cSusan Harper, did you do this?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling\r\nfrom head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\u201cRebecca Thatcher\u201d [Tom glanced at her face\u2014it was white with\r\nterror]\u2014\u201cdid you tear\u2014no, look me in the face\u201d [her hands rose in\r\nappeal]\u2014\u201cdid you tear this book?\u201d\r\n\r\nA thought shot like lightning through Tom\u2019s brain. He sprang to his feet\r\nand shouted\u2014\u201cI done it!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a\r\nmoment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward\r\nto go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that\r\nshone upon him out of poor Becky\u2019s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred\r\nfloggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without\r\nan outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever\r\nadministered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a\r\ncommand to remain two hours after school should be dismissed\u2014for he\r\nknew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not\r\ncount the tedious time as loss, either.\r\n\r\nTom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for\r\nwith shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own\r\ntreachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to\r\npleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky\u2019s latest words\r\nlingering dreamily in his ear\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, how _could_ you be so noble!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nVacation was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer\r\nand more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good\r\nshowing on \u201cExamination\u201d day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle\r\nnow\u2014at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young\r\nladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins\u2019 lashings\r\nwere very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a\r\nperfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there\r\nwas no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,\r\nall the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a\r\nvindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence\r\nwas, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and\r\ntheir nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do\r\nthe master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution\r\nthat followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that\r\nthe boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they\r\nconspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.\r\nThey swore in the signpainter\u2019s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his\r\nhelp. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded\r\nin his father\u2019s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.\r\nThe master\u2019s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and\r\nthere would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always\r\nprepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and\r\nthe signpainter\u2019s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper\r\ncondition on Examination Evening he would \u201cmanage the thing\u201d while he\r\nnapped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time\r\nand hurried away to school.\r\n\r\nIn the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in\r\nthe evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with\r\nwreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in\r\nhis great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.\r\nHe was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and\r\nsix rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town\r\nand by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of\r\ncitizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the\r\nscholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of\r\nsmall boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;\r\nrows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in\r\nlawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their\r\ngrandmothers\u2019 ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and\r\nthe flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with\r\nnon-participating scholars.\r\n\r\nThe exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,\u201d\r\n etc.\u2014accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic\r\ngestures which a machine might have used\u2014supposing the machine to be a\r\ntrifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,\r\nand got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nA little shamefaced girl lisped, \u201cMary had a little lamb,\u201d etc.,\r\nperformed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and\r\nsat down flushed and happy.\r\n\r\nTom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into\r\nthe unquenchable and indestructible \u201cGive me liberty or give me death\u201d\r\n speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the\r\nmiddle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under\r\nhim and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the\r\nhouse but he had the house\u2019s silence, too, which was even worse than\r\nits sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom\r\nstruggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak\r\nattempt at applause, but it died early.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Boy Stood on the Burning Deck\u201d followed; also \u201cThe Assyrian Came\r\nDown,\u201d and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,\r\nand a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The\r\nprime feature of the evening was in order, now\u2014original \u201ccompositions\u201d\r\nby the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the\r\nplatform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty\r\nribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to \u201cexpression\u201d\r\nand punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon\r\nsimilar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and\r\ndoubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the\r\nCrusades. \u201cFriendship\u201d was one; \u201cMemories of Other Days\u201d; \u201cReligion in\r\nHistory\u201d; \u201cDream Land\u201d; \u201cThe Advantages of Culture\u201d; \u201cForms of Political\r\nGovernment Compared and Contrasted\u201d; \u201cMelancholy\u201d; \u201cFilial Love\u201d; \u201cHeart\r\nLongings,\u201d etc., etc.\r\n\r\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted\r\nmelancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of \u201cfine language\u201d;\r\nanother was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words\r\nand phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that\r\nconspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable\r\nsermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of\r\nthem. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was\r\nmade to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious\r\nmind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of\r\nthese sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the\r\nfashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will\r\nbe sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all\r\nour land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their\r\ncompositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the\r\nmost frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the\r\nlongest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely\r\ntruth is unpalatable.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the \u201cExamination.\u201d The first composition that was read\r\nwas one entitled \u201cIs this, then, Life?\u201d Perhaps the reader can endure an\r\nextract from it:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the\r\nyouthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!\r\nImagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the\r\nvoluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, \u2018the\r\nobserved of all observers.\u2019 Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,\r\nis whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,\r\nher step is lightest in the gay assembly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour\r\narrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has\r\nhad such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her\r\nenchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But\r\nafter a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is\r\nvanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly\r\nupon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health\r\nand imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly\r\npleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to\r\ntime during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of \u201cHow\r\nsweet!\u201d \u201cHow eloquent!\u201d \u201cSo true!\u201d etc., and after the thing had closed\r\nwith a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the \u201cinteresting\u201d\r\n paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a \u201cpoem.\u201d Two\r\nstanzas of it will do:\r\n\r\n\u201cA MISSOURI MAIDEN\u2019S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\r\n\r\n\u201cAlabama, goodbye! I love thee well!\r\n    But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\r\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\r\n    And burning recollections throng my brow!\r\nFor I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\r\n    Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa\u2019s stream;\r\nHave listened to Tallassee\u2019s warring floods,\r\n    And wooed on Coosa\u2019s side Aurora\u2019s beam.\r\n\r\n\u201cYet shame I not to bear an o\u2019erfull heart,\r\n    Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\r\n\u2019Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\r\n    \u2019Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\r\nWelcome and home were mine within this State,\r\n    Whose vales I leave\u2014whose spires fade fast from me\r\nAnd cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and t\u00eate,\r\n    When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were very few there who knew what \u201c_t\u00eate_\u201d meant, but the poem\r\nwas very satisfactory, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,\r\nwho paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began\r\nto read in a measured, solemn tone:\r\n\r\n                              A VISION\r\n\r\nDark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single\r\nstar quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly\r\nvibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry\r\nmood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power\r\nexerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous\r\nwinds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered\r\nabout as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.\r\n\r\nAt such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit\r\nsighed; but instead thereof,\r\n\r\n     \u2018My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide\u2014\r\n     My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,\u2019 came to my side.\r\n\r\nShe moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks\r\nof fancy\u2019s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned\r\nsave by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it\r\nfailed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by\r\nher genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided\r\naway unperceived\u2014unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features,\r\nlike icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the\r\ncontending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a\r\nsermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took\r\nthe first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest\r\neffort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize\r\nto the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by\r\nfar the most \u201celoquent\u201d thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel\r\nWebster himself might well be proud of it.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which\r\nthe word \u201cbeauteous\u201d was over-fondled, and human experience referred to\r\nas \u201clife\u2019s page,\u201d was up to the usual average.\r\n\r\nNow the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair\r\naside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of\r\nAmerica on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he\r\nmade a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter\r\nrippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to\r\nright it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted\r\nthem more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his\r\nentire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down\r\nby the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined\r\nhe was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly\r\nincreased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with\r\na scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,\r\nsuspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about\r\nher head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she\r\ncurved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed\r\nat the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher\u2014the cat was\r\nwithin six inches of the absorbed teacher\u2019s head\u2014down, down, a little\r\nlower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,\r\nand was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still\r\nin her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master\u2019s\r\nbald pate\u2014for the signpainter\u2019s boy had _gilded_ it!\r\n\r\nThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.\r\n\r\n[*] NOTE:\u2014The pretended \u201ccompositions\u201d quoted in this chapter are taken\r\nwithout alteration from a volume entitled \u201cProse and Poetry, by a\r\nWestern Lady\u201d\u2014but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl\r\npattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nTom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the\r\nshowy character of their \u201cregalia.\u201d He promised to abstain from smoking,\r\nchewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out\r\na new thing\u2014namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way\r\nin the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon\r\nfound himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire\r\ngrew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display\r\nhimself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth\r\nof July was coming; but he soon gave that up\u2014gave it up before he had\r\nworn his shackles over forty-eight hours\u2014and fixed his hopes upon old\r\nJudge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed\r\nand would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.\r\nDuring three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge\u2019s condition\r\nand hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high\u2014so high that\r\nhe would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the\r\nlooking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.\r\nAt last he was pronounced upon the mend\u2014and then convalescent. Tom was\r\ndisgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation\r\nat once\u2014and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom\r\nresolved that he would never trust a man like that again.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated\r\nto kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,\r\nhowever\u2014there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now\u2014but\r\nfound to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he\r\ncould, took the desire away, and the charm of it.\r\n\r\nTom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning\r\nto hang a little heavily on his hands.\r\n\r\nHe attempted a diary\u2014but nothing happened during three days, and so he\r\nabandoned it.\r\n\r\nThe first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a\r\nsensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy\r\nfor two days.\r\n\r\nEven the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained\r\nhard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man\r\nin the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States\r\nSenator, proved an overwhelming disappointment\u2014for he was not\r\ntwenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.\r\n\r\nA circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents\r\nmade of rag carpeting\u2014admission, three pins for boys, two for girls\u2014and\r\nthen circusing was abandoned.\r\n\r\nA phrenologist and a mesmerizer came\u2014and went again and left the village\r\nduller and drearier than ever.\r\n\r\nThere were some boys-and-girls\u2019 parties, but they were so few and so\r\ndelightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.\r\n\r\nBecky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her\r\nparents during vacation\u2014so there was no bright side to life anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very\r\ncancer for permanency and pain.\r\n\r\nThen came the measles.\r\n\r\nDuring two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its\r\nhappenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got\r\nupon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had\r\ncome over everything and every creature. There had been a \u201crevival,\u201d and\r\neverybody had \u201cgot religion,\u201d not only the adults, but even the boys and\r\ngirls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed\r\nsinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe\r\nHarper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing\r\nspectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a\r\nbasket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to\r\nthe precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy\r\nhe encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in\r\ndesperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn\r\nand was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he\r\ncrept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,\r\nforever and forever.\r\n\r\nAnd that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful\r\nclaps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head\r\nwith the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for\r\nhe had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.\r\nHe believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the\r\nextremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have\r\nseemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a\r\nbattery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the\r\ngetting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from\r\nunder an insect like himself.\r\n\r\nBy and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its\r\nobject. The boy\u2019s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His\r\nsecond was to wait\u2014for there might not be any more storms.\r\n\r\nThe next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he\r\nspent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad\r\nat last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how\r\nlonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted\r\nlistlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a\r\njuvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her\r\nvictim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a\r\nstolen melon. Poor lads! they\u2014like Tom\u2014had suffered a relapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred\u2014and vigorously: the murder\r\ntrial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village\r\ntalk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to\r\nthe murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience\r\nand fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in\r\nhis hearing as \u201cfeelers\u201d; he did not see how he could be suspected of\r\nknowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable\r\nin the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.\r\nHe took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some\r\nrelief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of\r\ndistress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself\r\nthat Huck had remained discreet.\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, have you ever told anybody about\u2014that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Bout what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know what.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh\u2014\u2019course I haven\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever a word?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was afeard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn\u2019t be alive two days if that got found out.\r\n_You_ know that.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom felt more comfortable. After a pause:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, they couldn\u2019t anybody get you to tell, could they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they\r\ncould get me to tell. They ain\u2019t no different way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right, then. I reckon we\u2019re safe as long as we keep\r\nmum. But let\u2019s swear again, anyway. It\u2019s more surer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m agreed.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they swore again with dread solemnities.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the talk around, Huck? I\u2019ve heard a power of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTalk? Well, it\u2019s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the\r\ntime. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so\u2019s I want to hide som\u2019ers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he\u2019s a goner.\r\nDon\u2019t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost always\u2014most always. He ain\u2019t no account; but then he hain\u2019t ever\r\ndone anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to\r\nget drunk on\u2014and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do\r\nthat\u2014leastways most of us\u2014preachers and such like. But he\u2019s kind of\r\ngood\u2014he give me half a fish, once, when there warn\u2019t enough for two; and\r\nlots of times he\u2019s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.\r\nI wish we could get him out of there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy! we couldn\u2019t get him out, Tom. And besides, \u2019twouldn\u2019t do any good;\r\nthey\u2019d ketch him again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014so they would. But I hate to hear \u2019em abuse him so like the dickens\r\nwhen he never done\u2014that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do too, Tom. Lord, I hear \u2019em say he\u2019s the bloodiest looking villain\r\nin this country, and they wonder he wasn\u2019t ever hung before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they talk like that, all the time. I\u2019ve heard \u2019em say that if he\r\nwas to get free they\u2019d lynch him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they\u2019d do it, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the\r\ntwilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood\r\nof the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that\r\nsomething would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But\r\nnothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in\r\nthis luckless captive.\r\n\r\nThe boys did as they had often done before\u2014went to the cell grating and\r\ngave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and\r\nthere were no guards.\r\n\r\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences\r\nbefore\u2014it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and\r\ntreacherous to the last degree when Potter said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been mighty good to me, boys\u2014better\u2019n anybody else in this town.\r\nAnd I don\u2019t forget it, I don\u2019t. Often I says to myself, says I, \u2018I used\r\nto mend all the boys\u2019 kites and things, and show \u2019em where the good\r\nfishin\u2019 places was, and befriend \u2019em what I could, and now they\u2019ve\r\nall forgot old Muff when he\u2019s in trouble; but Tom don\u2019t, and Huck\r\ndon\u2019t\u2014_they_ don\u2019t forget him,\u2019 says I, \u2018and I don\u2019t forget them.\u2019 Well,\r\nboys, I done an awful thing\u2014drunk and crazy at the time\u2014that\u2019s the only\r\nway I account for it\u2014and now I got to swing for it, and it\u2019s right.\r\nRight, and _best_, too, I reckon\u2014hope so, anyway. Well, we won\u2019t talk\r\nabout that. I don\u2019t want to make _you_ feel bad; you\u2019ve befriended me.\r\nBut what I want to say, is, don\u2019t _you_ ever get drunk\u2014then you won\u2019t\r\never get here. Stand a litter furder west\u2014so\u2014that\u2019s it; it\u2019s a prime\r\ncomfort to see faces that\u2019s friendly when a body\u2019s in such a muck\r\nof trouble, and there don\u2019t none come here but yourn. Good friendly\r\nfaces\u2014good friendly faces. Git up on one another\u2019s backs and let me\r\ntouch \u2019em. That\u2019s it. Shake hands\u2014yourn\u2019ll come through the bars, but\r\nmine\u2019s too big. Little hands, and weak\u2014but they\u2019ve helped Muff Potter a\r\npower, and they\u2019d help him more if they could.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.\r\nThe next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an\r\nalmost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.\r\nHuck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.\r\nEach wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination\r\nalways brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers\r\nsauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing\r\nnews\u2014the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor\r\nPotter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect\r\nthat Injun Joe\u2019s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was\r\nnot the slightest question as to what the jury\u2019s verdict would be.\r\n\r\nTom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He\r\nwas in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to\r\nsleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for\r\nthis was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented\r\nin the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took\r\ntheir places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and\r\nhopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all\r\nthe curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,\r\nstolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and\r\nthe sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings\r\namong the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These\r\ndetails and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation\r\nthat was as impressive as it was fascinating.\r\n\r\nNow a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing\r\nin the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was\r\ndiscovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further\r\nquestioning, counsel for the prosecution said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when\r\nhis own counsel said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no questions to ask him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.\r\nCounsel for the prosecution said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no questions to ask him,\u201d Potter\u2019s lawyer replied.\r\n\r\nA third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter\u2019s\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\r\n\r\nCounsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience\r\nbegan to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his\r\nclient\u2019s life without an effort?\r\n\r\nSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Potter\u2019s guilty behavior when\r\nbrought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand\r\nwithout being cross-questioned.\r\n\r\nEvery detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the\r\ngraveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was\r\nbrought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined\r\nby Potter\u2019s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house\r\nexpressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.\r\nCounsel for the prosecution now said:\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have\r\nfastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the\r\nunhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.\u201d\r\n\r\nA groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and\r\nrocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned\r\nin the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women\u2019s compassion\r\ntestified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYour honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we\r\nforeshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed\r\nwhile under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced\r\nby drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.\u201d [Then\r\nto the clerk:] \u201cCall Thomas Sawyer!\u201d\r\n\r\nA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting\r\nPotter\u2019s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as\r\nhe rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,\r\nfor he was badly scared. The oath was administered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the\r\nhour of midnight?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom glanced at Injun Joe\u2019s iron face and his tongue failed him. The\r\naudience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few\r\nmoments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed\r\nto put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the graveyard!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little bit louder, please. Don\u2019t be afraid. You were\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the graveyard.\u201d\r\n\r\nA contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you anywhere near Horse Williams\u2019 grave?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak up\u2014just a trifle louder. How near were you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNear as I am to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you hidden, or not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was hid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBehind the elms that\u2019s on the edge of the grave.\u201d\r\n\r\nInjun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny one with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I went there with\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait\u2014wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion\u2019s name. We\r\nwill produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom hesitated and looked confused.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak out, my boy\u2014don\u2019t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.\r\nWhat did you take there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly a\u2014a\u2014dead cat.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us\r\neverything that occurred\u2014tell it in your own way\u2014don\u2019t skip anything,\r\nand don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom began\u2014hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his\r\nwords flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased\r\nbut his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and\r\nbated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,\r\nrapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent\r\nemotion reached its climax when the boy said:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun\r\nJoe jumped with the knife and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nCrash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his\r\nway through all opposers, and was gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nTom was a glittering hero once more\u2014the pet of the old, the envy of the\r\nyoung. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper\r\nmagnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,\r\nif he escaped hanging.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom\r\nand fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort\r\nof conduct is to the world\u2019s credit; therefore it is not well to find\r\nfault with it.\r\n\r\nTom\u2019s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights\r\nwere seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always\r\nwith doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy\r\nto stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of\r\nwretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer\r\nthe night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid\r\nthat his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding\r\nInjun Joe\u2019s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.\r\nThe poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of\r\nthat? Since Tom\u2019s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the\r\nlawyer\u2019s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had\r\nbeen sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck\u2019s\r\nconfidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.\r\n\r\nDaily Muff Potter\u2019s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly\r\nhe wished he had sealed up his tongue.\r\n\r\nHalf the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the\r\nother half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a\r\nsafe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.\r\n\r\nRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun\r\nJoe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a\r\ndetective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked\r\nwise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that\r\ncraft usually achieve. That is to say, he \u201cfound a clew.\u201d But you can\u2019t\r\nhang a \u201cclew\u201d for murder, and so after that detective had got through\r\nand gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.\r\n\r\nThe slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened\r\nweight of apprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThere comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy\u2019s life when he has\r\na raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire\r\nsuddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper,\r\nbut failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.\r\nPresently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would\r\nanswer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him\r\nconfidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand\r\nin any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,\r\nfor he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is\r\nnot money. \u201cWhere\u2019ll we dig?\u201d said Huck.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, most anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, is it hid all around?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed it ain\u2019t. It\u2019s hid in mighty particular places,\r\nHuck\u2014sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of\r\na limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but\r\nmostly under the floor in ha\u2019nted houses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho hides it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, robbers, of course\u2014who\u2019d you reckon? Sunday-school\r\nsup\u2019rintendents?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. If \u2019twas mine I wouldn\u2019t hide it; I\u2019d spend it and have a\r\ngood time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo would I. But robbers don\u2019t do that way. They always hide it and\r\nleave it there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t they come after it any more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else\r\nthey die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and\r\nby somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks\u2014a\r\npaper that\u2019s got to be ciphered over about a week because it\u2019s mostly\r\nsigns and hy\u2019roglyphics.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHyro\u2014which?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHy\u2019roglyphics\u2014pictures and things, you know, that don\u2019t seem to mean\r\nanything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you got one of them papers, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then, how you going to find the marks?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha\u2019nted house or on\r\nan island, or under a dead tree that\u2019s got one limb sticking out. Well,\r\nwe\u2019ve tried Jackson\u2019s Island a little, and we can try it again some\r\ntime; and there\u2019s the old ha\u2019nted house up the Still-House branch, and\r\nthere\u2019s lots of dead-limb trees\u2014dead loads of \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it under all of them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow you talk! No!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how you going to know which one to go for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo for all of \u2019em!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Tom, it\u2019ll take all summer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars\r\nin it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di\u2019monds. How\u2019s\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck\u2019s eyes glowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred\r\ndollars and I don\u2019t want no di\u2019monds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. But I bet you I ain\u2019t going to throw off on di\u2019monds. Some\r\nof \u2019em\u2019s worth twenty dollars apiece\u2014there ain\u2019t any, hardly, but\u2019s\r\nworth six bits or a dollar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! Is that so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCert\u2019nly\u2014anybody\u2019ll tell you so. Hain\u2019t you ever seen one, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot as I remember.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, kings have slathers of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019 know no kings, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon you don\u2019t. But if you was to go to Europe you\u2019d see a raft of\r\n\u2019em hopping around.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo they hop?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHop?\u2014your granny! No!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what did you say they did, for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks, I only meant you\u2019d _see_ \u2019em\u2014not hopping, of course\u2014what do\r\nthey want to hop for?\u2014but I mean you\u2019d just see \u2019em\u2014scattered around,\r\nyou know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRichard? What\u2019s his other name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any other name. Kings don\u2019t have any but a given name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don\u2019t want to be a king\r\nand have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say\u2014where you going\r\nto dig first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. S\u2019pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the\r\nhill t\u2019other side of Still-House branch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m agreed.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their\r\nthree-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves\r\ndown in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like this,\u201d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your\r\nshare?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I\u2019ll go to every\r\ncircus that comes along. I bet I\u2019ll have a gay time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, ain\u2019t you going to save any of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSave it? What for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, so as to have something to live on, by and by.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that ain\u2019t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day\r\nand get his claws on it if I didn\u2019t hurry up, and I tell you he\u2019d clean\r\nit out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to buy a new drum, and a sure\u2019nough sword, and a red necktie\r\nand a bull pup, and get married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, you\u2014why, you ain\u2019t in your right mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait\u2014you\u2019ll see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my\r\nmother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty\r\nwell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t anything. The girl I\u2019m going to marry won\u2019t fight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, I reckon they\u2019re all alike. They\u2019ll all comb a body. Now you\r\nbetter think \u2019bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What\u2019s the name\r\nof the gal?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t a gal at all\u2014it\u2019s a girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl\u2014both\u2019s\r\nright, like enough. Anyway, what\u2019s her name, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you some time\u2014not now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right\u2014that\u2019ll do. Only if you get married I\u2019ll be more lonesomer\r\nthan ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and\r\nwe\u2019ll go to digging.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another\r\nhalfhour. Still no result. Huck said:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo they always bury it as deep as this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes\u2014not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven\u2019t got the right\r\nplace.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,\r\nbut still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.\r\nFinally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his\r\nbrow with his sleeve, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere you going to dig next, after we get this one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon maybe we\u2019ll tackle the old tree that\u2019s over yonder on Cardiff\r\nHill back of the widow\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon that\u2019ll be a good one. But won\u2019t the widow take it away from\r\nus, Tom? It\u2019s on her land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_She_ take it away! Maybe she\u2019d like to try it once. Whoever finds one\r\nof these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don\u2019t make any difference\r\nwhose land it\u2019s on.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is mighty curious, Huck. I don\u2019t understand it. Sometimes witches\r\ninterfere. I reckon maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s the trouble now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks! Witches ain\u2019t got no power in the daytime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s so. I didn\u2019t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!\r\nWhat a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow\r\nof the limb falls at midnight, and that\u2019s where you dig!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen consound it, we\u2019ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang\r\nit all, we got to come back in the night. It\u2019s an awful long way. Can\r\nyou get out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet I will. We\u2019ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees\r\nthese holes they\u2019ll know in a minute what\u2019s here and they\u2019ll go for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll come around and maow tonight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s hide the tools in the bushes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in\r\nthe shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by\r\nold traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked\r\nin the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the\r\ndistance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were\r\nsubdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged\r\nthat twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to\r\ndig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and\r\ntheir industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,\r\nbut every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon\r\nsomething, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone\r\nor a chunk. At last Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t any use, Huck, we\u2019re wrong again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but we _can\u2019t_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it, but then there\u2019s another thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too\r\nearly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck dropped his shovel.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said he. \u201cThat\u2019s the very trouble. We got to give this one\r\nup. We can\u2019t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing\u2019s\r\ntoo awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering\r\naround so. I feel as if something\u2019s behind me all the time; and I\u2019m\r\nafeard to turn around, becuz maybe there\u2019s others in front a-waiting for\r\na chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a\r\ndead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLordy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they do. I\u2019ve always heard that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, I don\u2019t like to fool around much where there\u2019s dead people. A\r\nbody\u2019s bound to get into trouble with \u2019em, sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to stir \u2019em up, either. S\u2019pose this one here was to stick\r\nhis skull out and say something!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t Tom! It\u2019s awful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it just is. Huck, I don\u2019t feel comfortable a bit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Tom, let\u2019s give this place up, and try somewheres else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, I reckon we better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom considered awhile; and then said:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe ha\u2019nted house. That\u2019s it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame it, I don\u2019t like ha\u2019nted houses, Tom. Why, they\u2019re a dern sight\r\nworse\u2019n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don\u2019t come\r\nsliding around in a shroud, when you ain\u2019t noticing, and peep over your\r\nshoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I\r\ncouldn\u2019t stand such a thing as that, Tom\u2014nobody could.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but, Huck, ghosts don\u2019t travel around only at night. They won\u2019t\r\nhender us from digging there in the daytime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s so. But you know mighty well people don\u2019t go about that\r\nha\u2019nted house in the day nor the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s mostly because they don\u2019t like to go where a man\u2019s been\r\nmurdered, anyway\u2014but nothing\u2019s ever been seen around that house except\r\nin the night\u2014just some blue lights slipping by the windows\u2014no regular\r\nghosts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,\r\nyou can bet there\u2019s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.\r\nBecuz you know that they don\u2019t anybody but ghosts use \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s so. But anyway they don\u2019t come around in the daytime, so\r\nwhat\u2019s the use of our being afeard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, all right. We\u2019ll tackle the ha\u2019nted house if you say so\u2014but I\r\nreckon it\u2019s taking chances.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the\r\nmoonlit valley below them stood the \u201cha\u2019nted\u201d house, utterly isolated,\r\nits fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the\r\nchimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof\r\ncaved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit\r\npast a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the\r\ncircumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted\r\nhouse a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that\r\nadorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come\r\nfor their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was\r\nmeasurably so, also\u2014but suddenly said:\r\n\r\n\u201cLookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his\r\neyes with a startled look in them\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy! I never once thought of it, Huck!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was\r\nFriday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame it, a body can\u2019t be too careful, Huck. We might \u2019a\u2019 got into an\r\nawful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Might_! Better say we _would_! There\u2019s some lucky days, maybe, but\r\nFriday ain\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny fool knows that. I don\u2019t reckon _you_ was the first that found it\r\nout, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain\u2019t all, neither. I had a\r\nrotten bad dream last night\u2014dreampt about rats.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, Huck. When they don\u2019t fight it\u2019s only a sign that\r\nthere\u2019s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty\r\nsharp and keep out of it. We\u2019ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do\r\nyou know Robin Hood, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Who\u2019s Robin Hood?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England\u2014and the\r\nbest. He was a robber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But\r\nhe never bothered the poor. He loved \u2019em. He always divided up with \u2019em\r\nperfectly square.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he must \u2019a\u2019 been a brick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.\r\nThey ain\u2019t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in\r\nEngland, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow\r\nand plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a _yew_ bow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that\r\ndime only on the edge he would set down and cry\u2014and curse. But we\u2019ll\r\nplay Robin Hood\u2014it\u2019s nobby fun. I\u2019ll learn you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m agreed.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a\r\nyearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the\r\nmorrow\u2019s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink\r\ninto the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows\r\nof the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.\r\nThey had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their\r\nlast hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were\r\nso many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down\r\nwithin six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and\r\nturned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this\r\ntime, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling\r\nthat they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the\r\nrequirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and\r\ngrisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,\r\nand something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the\r\nplace, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they\r\ncrept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,\r\nfloorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,\r\na ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and\r\nabandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened\r\npulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,\r\nand muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\r\n\r\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the\r\nplace a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own\r\nboldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.\r\nThis was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring\r\neach other, and of course there could be but one result\u2014they threw their\r\ntools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of\r\ndecay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the\r\npromise was a fraud\u2014there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now\r\nand well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSh!\u201d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d whispered Huck, blanching with fright.\r\n\r\n\u201cSh!... There!... Hear it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes!... Oh, my! Let\u2019s run!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep still! Don\u2019t you budge! They\u2019re coming right toward the door.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to\r\nknotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve stopped.... No\u2014coming.... Here they are. Don\u2019t whisper another\r\nword, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo men entered. Each boy said to himself: \u201cThere\u2019s the old deaf and\r\ndumb Spaniard that\u2019s been about town once or twice lately\u2014never saw\r\nt\u2019other man before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cT\u2019other\u201d was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant\r\nin his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white\r\nwhiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore\r\ngreen goggles. When they came in, \u201ct\u2019other\u201d was talking in a low voice;\r\nthey sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the\r\nwall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less\r\nguarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019ve thought it all over, and I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s\r\ndangerous.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDangerous!\u201d grunted the \u201cdeaf and dumb\u201d Spaniard\u2014to the vast surprise\r\nof the boys. \u201cMilksop!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe\u2019s! There was\r\nsilence for some time. Then Joe said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s any more dangerous than that job up yonder\u2014but nothing\u2019s come of\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.\r\n\u2019Twon\u2019t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!\u2014anybody\r\nwould suspicion us that saw us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that. But there warn\u2019t any other place as handy after that fool\r\nof a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it\r\nwarn\u2019t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys\r\nplaying over there on the hill right in full view.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThose infernal boys\u201d quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,\r\nand thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and\r\nconcluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and\r\nthoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, lad\u2014you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there\r\ntill you hear from me. I\u2019ll take the chances on dropping into this town\r\njust once more, for a look. We\u2019ll do that \u2018dangerous\u2019 job after I\u2019ve\r\nspied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!\r\nWe\u2019ll leg it together!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m dead for sleep! It\u2019s your turn to watch.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred\r\nhim once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to\r\nnod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.\r\n\r\nThe boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow\u2019s our chance\u2014come!\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I\u2019d die if they was to wake.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom urged\u2014Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and\r\nstarted alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak\r\nfrom the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never\r\nmade a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments\r\ntill it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;\r\nand then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.\r\n\r\nNow one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around\u2014smiled grimly upon\r\nhis comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees\u2014stirred him up with\r\nhis foot and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere! _You\u2019re_ a watchman, ain\u2019t you! All right, though\u2014nothing\u2019s\r\nhappened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy! have I been asleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What\u2019ll we\r\ndo with what little swag we\u2019ve got left?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014leave it here as we\u2019ve always done, I reckon. No use to\r\ntake it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver\u2019s\r\nsomething to carry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014all right\u2014it won\u2019t matter to come here once more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014but I\u2019d say come in the night as we used to do\u2014it\u2019s better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right\r\nchance at that job; accidents might happen; \u2019tain\u2019t in such a very good\r\nplace; we\u2019ll just regularly bury it\u2014and bury it deep.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,\r\nraised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled\r\npleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself\r\nand as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on\r\nhis knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.\r\n\r\nThe boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With\r\ngloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!\u2014the splendor of it was\r\nbeyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make\r\nhalf a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest\r\nauspices\u2014there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to\r\ndig. They nudged each other every moment\u2014eloquent nudges and easily\r\nunderstood, for they simply meant\u2014\u201cOh, but ain\u2019t you glad _now_ we\u2019re\r\nhere!\u201d\r\n\r\nJoe\u2019s knife struck upon something.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said his comrade.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalf-rotten plank\u2014no, it\u2019s a box, I believe. Here\u2014bear a hand and we\u2019ll\r\nsee what it\u2019s here for. Never mind, I\u2019ve broke a hole.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe reached his hand in and drew it out\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s money!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys\r\nabove were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.\r\n\r\nJoe\u2019s comrade said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make quick work of this. There\u2019s an old rusty pick over amongst\r\nthe weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace\u2014I saw it a\r\nminute ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe ran and brought the boys\u2019 pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the\r\npick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to\r\nhimself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was\r\nnot very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the\r\nslow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in\r\nblissful silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cPard, there\u2019s thousands of dollars here,\u201d said Injun Joe.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Twas always said that Murrel\u2019s gang used to be around here one\r\nsummer,\u201d the stranger observed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it,\u201d said Injun Joe; \u201cand this looks like it, I should say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you won\u2019t need to do that job.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe halfbreed frowned. Said he:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know me. Least you don\u2019t know all about that thing. \u2019Tain\u2019t\r\nrobbery altogether\u2014it\u2019s _revenge_!\u201d and a wicked light flamed in his\r\neyes. \u201cI\u2019ll need your help in it. When it\u2019s finished\u2014then Texas. Go home\r\nto your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014if you say so; what\u2019ll we do with this\u2014bury it again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! by the great Sachem, no!\r\n[Profound distress overhead.] I\u2019d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh\r\nearth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business\r\nhas a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on\r\nthem? Who brought them here\u2014and where are they gone? Have you heard\r\nanybody?\u2014seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and\r\nsee the ground disturbed? Not exactly\u2014not exactly. We\u2019ll take it to my\r\nden.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number\r\nOne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014Number Two\u2014under the cross. The other place is bad\u2014too common.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. It\u2019s nearly dark enough to start.\u201d\r\n\r\nInjun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping\r\nout. Presently he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be\r\nupstairs?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys\u2019 breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,\r\nhalted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The\r\nboys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came\r\ncreaking up the stairs\u2014the intolerable distress of the situation woke\r\nthe stricken resolution of the lads\u2014they were about to spring for the\r\ncloset, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on\r\nthe ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself\r\nup cursing, and his comrade said:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow what\u2019s the use of all that? If it\u2019s anybody, and they\u2019re up there,\r\nlet them _stay_ there\u2014who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get\r\ninto trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes\u2014and then\r\nlet them follow us if they want to. I\u2019m willing. In my opinion, whoever\r\nhove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or\r\ndevils or something. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019re running yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nJoe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight\r\nwas left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.\r\nShortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening\r\ntwilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.\r\n\r\nTom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them\r\nthrough the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They\r\nwere content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the\r\ntownward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much\r\nabsorbed in hating themselves\u2014hating the ill luck that made them take\r\nthe spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have\r\nsuspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait\r\nthere till his \u201crevenge\u201d was satisfied, and then he would have had the\r\nmisfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that\r\nthe tools were ever brought there!\r\n\r\nThey resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to\r\ntown spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to\r\n\u201cNumber Two,\u201d wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\u201cRevenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t!\u201d said Huck, nearly fainting.\r\n\r\nThey talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe\r\nthat he might possibly mean somebody else\u2014at least that he might at\r\nleast mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.\r\n\r\nVery, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company\r\nwould be a palpable improvement, he thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom\u2019s dreams that night.\r\nFour times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times\r\nit wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and\r\nwakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay\r\nin the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he\r\nnoticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away\u2014somewhat as if\r\nthey had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it\r\noccurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There\r\nwas one very strong argument in favor of this idea\u2014namely, that the\r\nquantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen\r\nas much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of\r\nhis age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to\r\n\u201chundreds\u201d and \u201cthousands\u201d were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that\r\nno such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for\r\na moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in\r\nactual money in any one\u2019s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure\r\nhad been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of\r\nreal dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.\r\n\r\nBut the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer\r\nunder the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found\r\nhimself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a\r\ndream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a\r\nhurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale\r\nof a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking\r\nvery melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If\r\nhe did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, Huck!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nSilence, for a minute.\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, if we\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 left the blame tools at the dead tree, we\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 got\r\nthe money. Oh, ain\u2019t it awful!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tain\u2019t a dream, then, \u2019tain\u2019t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.\r\nDog\u2019d if I don\u2019t, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat ain\u2019t a dream?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDream! If them stairs hadn\u2019t broke down you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 seen how much dream\r\nit was! I\u2019ve had dreams enough all night\u2014with that patch-eyed Spanish\r\ndevil going for me all through \u2019em\u2014rot him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, we\u2019ll never find him. A feller don\u2019t have only one chance for such\r\na pile\u2014and that one\u2019s lost. I\u2019d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,\r\nanyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, so\u2019d I; but I\u2019d like to see him, anyway\u2014and track him out\u2014to his\r\nNumber Two.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNumber Two\u2014yes, that\u2019s it. I been thinking \u2019bout that. But I can\u2019t make\r\nnothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dono. It\u2019s too deep. Say, Huck\u2014maybe it\u2019s the number of a house!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGoody!... No, Tom, that ain\u2019t it. If it is, it ain\u2019t in this one-horse\r\ntown. They ain\u2019t no numbers here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s so. Lemme think a minute. Here\u2014it\u2019s the number of a\r\nroom\u2014in a tavern, you know!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s the trick! They ain\u2019t only two taverns. We can find out\r\nquick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou stay here, Huck, till I come.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck\u2019s company in public\r\nplaces. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.\r\n2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.\r\nIn the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper\u2019s\r\nyoung son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody\r\ngo into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any\r\nparticular reason for this state of things; had had some little\r\ncuriosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery\r\nby entertaining himself with the idea that that room was \u201cha\u2019nted\u201d; had\r\nnoticed that there was a light in there the night before.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve found out, Huck. I reckon that\u2019s the very No. 2 we\u2019re\r\nafter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLemme think.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom thought a long time. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out\r\ninto that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap\r\nof a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and\r\nI\u2019ll nip all of auntie\u2019s, and the first dark night we\u2019ll go there and\r\ntry \u2019em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he\r\nwas going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get\r\nhis revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don\u2019t go to\r\nthat No. 2, that ain\u2019t the place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLordy, I don\u2019t want to foller him by myself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019ll be night, sure. He mightn\u2019t ever see you\u2014and if he did,\r\nmaybe he\u2019d never think anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s pretty dark I reckon I\u2019ll track him. I dono\u2014I dono. I\u2019ll\r\ntry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou bet I\u2019ll follow him, if it\u2019s dark, Huck. Why, he might \u2019a\u2019 found\r\nout he couldn\u2019t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so, Tom, it\u2019s so. I\u2019ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re _talking_! Don\u2019t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about\r\nthe neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley\r\nat a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or\r\nleft it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern\r\ndoor. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the\r\nunderstanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck\r\nwas to come and \u201cmaow,\u201d whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.\r\nBut the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to\r\nbed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\r\n\r\nTuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday\r\nnight promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt\u2019s\r\nold tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the\r\nlantern in Huck\u2019s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before\r\nmidnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)\r\nwere put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the\r\nalley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,\r\nthe perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of\r\ndistant thunder.\r\n\r\nTom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the\r\ntowel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.\r\nHuck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was\r\na season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck\u2019s spirits like a\r\nmountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern\u2014it\r\nwould frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive\r\nyet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have\r\nfainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and\r\nexcitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer\r\nand closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and\r\nmomentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away\r\nhis breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to\r\ninhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the\r\nway it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came\r\ntearing by him: \u201cRun!\u201d said he; \u201crun, for your life!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe needn\u2019t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or\r\nforty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never\r\nstopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the\r\nlower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm\r\nburst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;\r\nbut they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn\u2019t hardly\r\nget my breath I was so scared. They wouldn\u2019t turn in the lock, either.\r\nWell, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and\r\nopen comes the door! It warn\u2019t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the\r\ntowel, and, _Great Caesar\u2019s Ghost!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u2014what\u2019d you see, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe\u2019s hand!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch\r\non his eye and his arms spread out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and\r\nstarted!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d never \u2019a\u2019 thought of the towel, I bet!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Tom, did you see that box?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, I didn\u2019t wait to look around. I didn\u2019t see the box, I didn\u2019t see\r\nthe cross. I didn\u2019t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor\r\nby Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.\r\nDon\u2019t you see, now, what\u2019s the matter with that ha\u2019nted room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s ha\u2019nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have\r\ngot a ha\u2019nted room, hey, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I reckon maybe that\u2019s so. Who\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 thought such a thing? But\r\nsay, Tom, now\u2019s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe\u2019s\r\ndrunk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, that! You try it!\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck shuddered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, no\u2014I reckon not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain\u2019t\r\nenough. If there\u2019d been three, he\u2019d be drunk enough and I\u2019d do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun\r\nJoe\u2019s not in there. It\u2019s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we\u2019ll\r\nbe dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we\u2019ll\r\nsnatch that box quicker\u2019n lightning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m agreed. I\u2019ll watch the whole night long, and I\u2019ll do it every\r\nnight, too, if you\u2019ll do the other part of the job.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a\r\nblock and maow\u2014and if I\u2019m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window\r\nand that\u2019ll fetch me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAgreed, and good as wheat!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Huck, the storm\u2019s over, and I\u2019ll go home. It\u2019ll begin to be\r\ndaylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI said I would, Tom, and I will. I\u2019ll ha\u2019nt that tavern every night for\r\na year! I\u2019ll sleep all day and I\u2019ll stand watch all night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Ben Rogers\u2019 hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap\u2019s nigger man,\r\nUncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any\r\ntime I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.\r\nThat\u2019s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don\u2019t ever act as\r\nif I was above him. Sometime I\u2019ve set right down and eat _with_ him. But\r\nyou needn\u2019t tell that. A body\u2019s got to do things when he\u2019s awful hungry\r\nhe wouldn\u2019t want to do as a steady thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if I don\u2019t want you in the daytime, I\u2019ll let you sleep. I won\u2019t\r\ncome bothering around. Any time you see something\u2019s up, in the night,\r\njust skip right around and maow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of\r\nnews\u2014Judge Thatcher\u2019s family had come back to town the night before.\r\nBoth Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a\r\nmoment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy\u2019s interest. He saw her\r\nand they had an exhausting good time playing \u201chispy\u201d and \u201cgully-keeper\u201d\r\n with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in\r\na peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint\r\nthe next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she\r\nconsented. The child\u2019s delight was boundless; and Tom\u2019s not more\r\nmoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway\r\nthe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation\r\nand pleasurable anticipation. Tom\u2019s excitement enabled him to keep\r\nawake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck\u2019s\r\n\u201cmaow,\u201d and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers\r\nwith, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.\r\n\r\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o\u2019clock a giddy and\r\nrollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher\u2019s, and everything was\r\nready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the\r\npicnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough\r\nunder the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young\r\ngentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was\r\nchartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main\r\nstreet laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss\r\nthe fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.\r\nThatcher said to Becky, was:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll not get back till late. Perhaps you\u2019d better stay all night with\r\nsome of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. And mind and behave yourself and don\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay\u2014I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll do. \u2019Stead of going to Joe Harper\u2019s we\u2019ll\r\nclimb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas\u2019. She\u2019ll have\r\nice-cream! She has it most every day\u2014dead loads of it. And she\u2019ll be\r\nawful glad to have us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that will be fun!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what will mamma say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2019ll she ever know?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon it\u2019s wrong\u2014but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut shucks! Your mother won\u2019t know, and so what\u2019s the harm? All she\r\nwants is that you\u2019ll be safe; and I bet you she\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 said go there if\r\nshe\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 thought of it. I know she would!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Widow Douglas\u2019 splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and\r\nTom\u2019s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say\r\nnothing to anybody about the night\u2019s programme. Presently it occurred to\r\nTom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The\r\nthought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he\r\ncould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas\u2019. And why should he\r\ngive it up, he reasoned\u2014the signal did not come the night before, so\r\nwhy should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the\r\nevening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined\r\nto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of\r\nthe box of money another time that day.\r\n\r\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\r\nhollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest\r\ndistances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and\r\nlaughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone\r\nthrough with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified\r\nwith responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things\r\nbegan. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in\r\nthe shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s ready for the cave?\u201d\r\n\r\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there\r\nwas a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the\r\nhillside\u2014an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood\r\nunbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled\r\nby Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was\r\nromantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out\r\nupon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the\r\nsituation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment\r\na candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a\r\nstruggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked\r\ndown or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a\r\nnew chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went\r\nfiling down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of\r\nlights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of\r\njunction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than\r\neight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower\r\ncrevices branched from it on either hand\u2014for McDougal\u2019s cave was but a\r\nvast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again\r\nand led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights\r\ntogether through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never\r\nfind the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and\r\nstill down, into the earth, and it was just the same\u2014labyrinth under\r\nlabyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man \u201cknew\u201d the cave. That was\r\nan impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it\r\nwas not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer\r\nknew as much of the cave as any one.\r\n\r\nThe procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of\r\na mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch\r\navenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise\r\nat points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude\r\neach other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the\r\n\u201cknown\u201d ground.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth\r\nof the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow\r\ndrippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of\r\nthe day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking\r\nno note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had\r\nbeen calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day\u2019s\r\nadventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat\r\nwith her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for\r\nthe wasted time but the captain of the craft.\r\n\r\nHuck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat\u2019s lights went\r\nglinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young\r\npeople were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly\r\ntired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not\r\nstop at the wharf\u2014and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his\r\nattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten\r\no\u2019clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\r\nto wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\r\nbetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\r\nsilence and the ghosts. Eleven o\u2019clock came, and the tavern lights were\r\nput out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long\r\ntime, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?\r\nWas there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?\r\n\r\nA noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley\r\ndoor closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next\r\nmoment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under\r\nhis arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.\r\nWhy call Tom now? It would be absurd\u2014the men would get away with the box\r\nand never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow\r\nthem; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So\r\ncommuning with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the\r\nmen, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough\r\nahead not to be invisible.\r\n\r\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up\r\na crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the\r\npath that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old\r\nWelshman\u2019s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still\r\nclimbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.\r\nBut they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.\r\nThey plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and\r\nwere at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his\r\ndistance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along\r\nawhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved\r\non a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that\r\nhe seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an\r\nowl came over the hill\u2014ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was\r\neverything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man\r\ncleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck\u2019s heart shot into his\r\nthroat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as\r\nif a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he\r\nthought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He\r\nknew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas\u2019\r\ngrounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won\u2019t be hard\r\nto find.\r\n\r\nNow there was a voice\u2014a very low voice\u2014Injun Joe\u2019s:\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn her, maybe she\u2019s got company\u2014there\u2019s lights, late as it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see any.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was that stranger\u2019s voice\u2014the stranger of the haunted house. A\r\ndeadly chill went to Huck\u2019s heart\u2014this, then, was the \u201crevenge\u201d job! His\r\nthought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been\r\nkind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder\r\nher. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn\u2019t\r\ndare\u2014they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in\r\nthe moment that elapsed between the stranger\u2019s remark and Injun Joe\u2019s\r\nnext\u2014which was\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause the bush is in your way. Now\u2014this way\u2014now you see, don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and\r\nmaybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I\u2019ve told you\r\nbefore, I don\u2019t care for her swag\u2014you may have it. But her husband was\r\nrough on me\u2014many times he was rough on me\u2014and mainly he was the justice\r\nof the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain\u2019t all. It ain\u2019t\r\na millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!\u2014horsewhipped in\r\nfront of the jail, like a nigger!\u2014with all the town looking on!\r\n_Horsewhipped_!\u2014do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But\r\nI\u2019ll take it out of _her_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t kill her! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was\r\nhere; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don\u2019t\r\nkill her\u2014bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils\u2014you notch her\r\nears like a sow!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy God, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I\u2019ll tie her\r\nto the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I\u2019ll not cry, if\r\nshe does. My friend, you\u2019ll help me in this thing\u2014for _my_ sake\u2014that\u2019s\r\nwhy you\u2019re here\u2014I mightn\u2019t be able alone. If you flinch, I\u2019ll kill you.\r\nDo you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I\u2019ll kill her\u2014and\r\nthen I reckon nobody\u2019ll ever know much about who done this business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s got to be done, let\u2019s get at it. The quicker the\r\nbetter\u2014I\u2019m all in a shiver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo it _now_? And company there? Look here\u2014I\u2019ll get suspicious of you,\r\nfirst thing you know. No\u2014we\u2019ll wait till the lights are out\u2014there\u2019s no\r\nhurry.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck felt that a silence was going to ensue\u2014a thing still more awful\r\nthan any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped\r\ngingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,\r\none-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one\r\nside and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same\r\nelaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and\u2014a twig\r\nsnapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no\r\nsound\u2014the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he\r\nturned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes\u2014turned\r\nhimself as carefully as if he were a ship\u2014and then stepped quickly but\r\ncautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and\r\nso he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he\r\nreached the Welshman\u2019s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads\r\nof the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the row there? Who\u2019s banging? What do you want?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me in\u2014quick! I\u2019ll tell everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, who are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuckleberry Finn\u2014quick, let me in!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain\u2019t a name to open many doors, I judge!\r\nBut let him in, lads, and let\u2019s see what\u2019s the trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ever tell I told you,\u201d were Huck\u2019s first words when he got\r\nin. \u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2014I\u2019d be killed, sure\u2014but the widow\u2019s been good friends\r\nto me sometimes, and I want to tell\u2014I _will_ tell if you\u2019ll promise you\r\nwon\u2019t ever say it was me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn\u2019t act so!\u201d\r\n exclaimed the old man; \u201cout with it and nobody here\u2019ll ever tell, lad.\u201d\r\n\r\nThree minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the\r\nhill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in\r\ntheir hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great\r\nbowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and\r\nthen all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.\r\n\r\nHuck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as\r\nfast as his legs could carry him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came\r\ngroping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman\u2019s door. The\r\ninmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,\r\non account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a\r\nwindow:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there!\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck\u2019s scared voice answered in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease let me in! It\u2019s only Huck Finn!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!\u2014and welcome!\u201d\r\n\r\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy\u2019s ears, and the pleasantest\r\nhe had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever\r\nbeen applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he\r\nentered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall\r\nsons speedily dressed themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my boy, I hope you\u2019re good and hungry, because breakfast will be\r\nready as soon as the sun\u2019s up, and we\u2019ll have a piping hot one, too\u2014make\r\nyourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you\u2019d turn up and stop\r\nhere last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was awful scared,\u201d said Huck, \u201cand I run. I took out when the pistols\r\nwent off, and I didn\u2019t stop for three mile. I\u2019ve come now becuz I wanted\r\nto know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn\u2019t\r\nwant to run across them devils, even if they was dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, poor chap, you do look as if you\u2019d had a hard night of it\u2014but\r\nthere\u2019s a bed here for you when you\u2019ve had your breakfast. No, they\r\nain\u2019t dead, lad\u2014we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right\r\nwhere to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along\r\non tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them\u2014dark as a cellar that\r\nsumach path was\u2014and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the\r\nmeanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use\u2014\u2019twas bound to\r\ncome, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when\r\nthe sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,\r\nI sung out, \u2018Fire boys!\u2019 and blazed away at the place where the rustling\r\nwas. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and\r\nwe after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.\r\nThey fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by\r\nand didn\u2019t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet\r\nwe quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a\r\nposse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it\r\nis light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys\r\nwill be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of\r\nthose rascals\u2014\u2019twould help a good deal. But you couldn\u2019t see what they\r\nwere like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSplendid! Describe them\u2014describe them, my boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne\u2019s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that\u2019s ben around here once or\r\ntwice, and t\u2019other\u2019s a mean-looking, ragged\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back\r\nof the widow\u2019s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and\r\ntell the sheriff\u2014get your breakfast tomorrow morning!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Welshman\u2019s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck\r\nsprang up and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, please don\u2019t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,\r\nplease!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what\r\nyou did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, no! Please don\u2019t tell!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t tell\u2014and I won\u2019t. But why don\u2019t you want it known?\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too\r\nmuch about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew\r\nanything against him for the whole world\u2014he would be killed for knowing\r\nit, sure.\r\n\r\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking\r\nsuspicious?\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you see, I\u2019m a kind of a hard lot,\u2014least everybody says so, and\r\nI don\u2019t see nothing agin it\u2014and sometimes I can\u2019t sleep much, on account\r\nof thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of\r\ndoing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn\u2019t sleep, and so I\r\ncome along upstreet \u2019bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I\r\ngot to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed\r\nup agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes\r\nthese two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their\r\narm, and I reckoned they\u2019d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t\u2019other one\r\nwanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up\r\ntheir faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,\r\nby his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t\u2019other one was a\r\nrusty, ragged-looking devil.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould you see the rags by the light of the cigars?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2014but somehow it seems as if I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen they went on, and you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFollered \u2019em\u2014yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up\u2014they sneaked\r\nalong so. I dogged \u2019em to the widder\u2019s stile, and stood in the dark and\r\nheard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he\u2019d\r\nspile her looks just as I told you and your two\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep\r\nthe old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,\r\nand yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of\r\nall he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,\r\nbut the old man\u2019s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.\r\nPresently the Welshman said:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy boy, don\u2019t be afraid of me. I wouldn\u2019t hurt a hair of your head for\r\nall the world. No\u2014I\u2019d protect you\u2014I\u2019d protect you. This Spaniard is\r\nnot deaf and dumb; you\u2019ve let that slip without intending it; you can\u2019t\r\ncover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want\r\nto keep dark. Now trust me\u2014tell me what it is, and trust me\u2014I won\u2019t\r\nbetray you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck looked into the old man\u2019s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and\r\nwhispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tain\u2019t a Spaniard\u2014it\u2019s Injun Joe!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and\r\nslitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because\r\nwhite men don\u2019t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That\u2019s a\r\ndifferent matter altogether.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man\r\nsaid that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going\r\nto bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for\r\nmarks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOf _what_?\u201d\r\n\r\nIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more\r\nstunning suddenness from Huck\u2019s blanched lips. His eyes were staring\r\nwide, now, and his breath suspended\u2014waiting for the answer. The Welshman\r\nstarted\u2014stared in return\u2014three seconds\u2014five seconds\u2014ten\u2014then replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cOf burglar\u2019s tools. Why, what\u2019s the _matter_ with you?\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The\r\nWelshman eyed him gravely, curiously\u2014and presently said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, burglar\u2019s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what\r\ndid give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we\u2019d found?\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck was in a close place\u2014the inquiring eye was upon him\u2014he would have\r\ngiven anything for material for a plausible answer\u2014nothing suggested\r\nitself\u2014the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper\u2014a senseless\r\nreply offered\u2014there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered\r\nit\u2014feebly:\r\n\r\n\u201cSunday-school books, maybe.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and\r\njoyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and\r\nended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man\u2019s pocket, because\r\nit cut down the doctor\u2019s bill like everything. Then he added:\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor old chap, you\u2019re white and jaded\u2014you ain\u2019t well a bit\u2014no wonder\r\nyou\u2019re a little flighty and off your balance. But you\u2019ll come out of it.\r\nRest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such\r\na suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel\r\nbrought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the\r\ntalk at the widow\u2019s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,\r\nhowever\u2014he had not known that it wasn\u2019t\u2014and so the suggestion of a\r\ncaptured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole\r\nhe felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all\r\nquestion that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was\r\nat rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be\r\ndrifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still\r\nin No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and\r\nTom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nJust as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck\r\njumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even\r\nremotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and\r\ngentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of\r\ncitizens were climbing up the hill\u2014to stare at the stile. So the news\r\nhad spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the\r\nvisitors. The widow\u2019s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say a word about it, madam. There\u2019s another that you\u2019re more\r\nbeholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don\u2019t allow me\r\nto tell his name. We wouldn\u2019t have been there but for him.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the\r\nmain matter\u2014but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his\r\nvisitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he\r\nrefused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the\r\nwidow said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that\r\nnoise. Why didn\u2019t you come and wake me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe judged it warn\u2019t worth while. Those fellows warn\u2019t likely to come\r\nagain\u2014they hadn\u2019t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of\r\nwaking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard\r\nat your house all the rest of the night. They\u2019ve just come back.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple\r\nof hours more.\r\n\r\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody\r\nwas early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came\r\nthat not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the\r\nsermon was finished, Judge Thatcher\u2019s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.\r\nHarper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired\r\nto death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Becky?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d with a startled look\u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t she stay with you last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, no.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,\r\ntalking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I\u2019ve got a boy\r\nthat\u2019s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last\r\nnight\u2014one of you. And now he\u2019s afraid to come to church. I\u2019ve got to\r\nsettle with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t stay with us,\u201d said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A\r\nmarked anxiety came into Aunt Polly\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cJoe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2019m.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you see him last?\u201d\r\n\r\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had\r\nstopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding\r\nuneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously\r\nquestioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed\r\nwhether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;\r\nit was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One\r\nyoung man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!\r\nMrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to\r\nstreet, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and\r\nthe whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant\r\ninsignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs\r\nwere manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half\r\nan hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\nAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women\r\nvisited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They\r\ncried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the\r\ntedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at\r\nlast, all the word that came was, \u201cSend more candles\u2014and send food.\u201d\r\n Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher\r\nsent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed\r\nno real cheer.\r\n\r\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with\r\ncandle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck\r\nstill in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with\r\nfever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came\r\nand took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,\r\nbecause, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord\u2019s,\r\nand nothing that was the Lord\u2019s was a thing to be neglected. The\r\nWelshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can depend on it. That\u2019s the Lord\u2019s mark. He don\u2019t leave it off.\r\nHe never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his\r\nhands.\u201d\r\n\r\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the\r\nvillage, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the\r\nnews that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being\r\nransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and\r\ncrevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered\r\nthrough the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither\r\nand thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their\r\nhollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,\r\nfar from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names \u201cBECKY &\r\nTOM\u201d had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and\r\nnear at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the\r\nribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever\r\nhave of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so\r\nprecious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the\r\nawful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away\r\nspeck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst\r\nforth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle\u2014and then a\r\nsickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;\r\nit was only a searcher\u2019s light.\r\n\r\nThree dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and\r\nthe village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.\r\nThe accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the\r\nTemperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the\r\npublic pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck\r\nfeebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked\u2014dimly\r\ndreading the worst\u2014if anything had been discovered at the Temperance\r\nTavern since he had been ill.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the widow.\r\n\r\nHuck started up in bed, wildeyed:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat? What was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLiquor!\u2014and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child\u2014what a turn you\r\ndid give me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly tell me just one thing\u2014only just one\u2014please! Was it Tom Sawyer\r\nthat found it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe widow burst into tears. \u201cHush, hush, child, hush! I\u2019ve told you\r\nbefore, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great\r\npowwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever\u2014gone\r\nforever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck\u2019s mind, and under the\r\nweariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2014he\u2019s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody\r\ncould find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain\u2019t many left, now, that\u2019s got hope\r\nenough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nNow to return to Tom and Becky\u2019s share in the picnic. They tripped along\r\nthe murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar\r\nwonders of the cave\u2014wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,\r\nsuch as \u201cThe Drawing-Room,\u201d \u201cThe Cathedral,\u201d \u201cAladdin\u2019s Palace,\u201d and\r\nso on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky\r\nengaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle\r\nwearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their\r\ncandles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,\r\npostoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been\r\nfrescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they\r\nscarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls\r\nwere not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging\r\nshelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream\r\nof water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with\r\nit, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara\r\nin gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind\r\nit in order to illuminate it for Becky\u2019s gratification. He found that\r\nit curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between\r\nnarrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.\r\n\r\nBecky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future\r\nguidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,\r\nfar down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and\r\nbranched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In\r\none place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a\r\nmultitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of\r\na man\u2019s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and\r\npresently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into\r\nit. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was\r\nincrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst\r\nof a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which\r\nhad been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites\r\ntogether, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the\r\nroof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a\r\nbunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by\r\nhundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their\r\nways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky\u2019s hand and\r\nhurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for\r\na bat struck Becky\u2019s light out with its wing while she was passing out\r\nof the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the\r\nfugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got\r\nrid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,\r\nwhich stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the\r\nshadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would\r\nbe best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the\r\ndeep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the\r\nchildren. Becky said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I didn\u2019t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of\r\nthe others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome to think, Becky, we are away down below them\u2014and I don\u2019t know how\r\nfar away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn\u2019t hear\r\nthem here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBecky grew apprehensive.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder how long we\u2019ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I reckon we better. P\u2019raps we better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you find the way, Tom? It\u2019s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon I could find it\u2014but then the bats. If they put our candles\r\nout it will be an awful fix. Let\u2019s try some other way, so as not to go\r\nthrough there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell. But I hope we won\u2019t get lost. It would be so awful!\u201d and the girl\r\nshuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.\r\n\r\nThey started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long\r\nway, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar\r\nabout the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an\r\nexamination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he\r\nwould say cheerily:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s all right. This ain\u2019t the one, but we\u2019ll come to it right\r\naway!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began\r\nto turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of\r\nfinding the one that was wanted. He still said it was \u201call right,\u201d but\r\nthere was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their\r\nring and sounded just as if he had said, \u201cAll is lost!\u201d Becky clung to\r\nhis side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,\r\nbut they would come. At last she said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tom, never mind the bats, let\u2019s go back that way! We seem to get\r\nworse and worse off all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cListen!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were\r\nconspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down\r\nthe empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that\r\nresembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,\u201d said Becky.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,\u201d and\r\nhe shouted again.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cmight\u201d was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so\r\nconfessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but\r\nthere was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried\r\nhis steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his\r\nmanner revealed another fearful fact to Becky\u2014he could not find his way\r\nback!\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tom, you didn\u2019t make any marks!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to\r\ncome back! No\u2014I can\u2019t find the way. It\u2019s all mixed up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, Tom, we\u2019re lost! we\u2019re lost! We never can get out of this awful\r\nplace! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom\r\nwas appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He\r\nsat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in\r\nhis bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing\r\nregrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom\r\nbegged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell\r\nto blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable\r\nsituation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope\r\nagain, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he\r\nwould not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nSo they moved on again\u2014aimlessly\u2014simply at random\u2014all they could do\r\nwas to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of\r\nreviving\u2014not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its\r\nnature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and\r\nfamiliarity with failure.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by Tom took Becky\u2019s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so\r\nmuch! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.\r\nShe knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his\r\npockets\u2014yet he must economize.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay\r\nattention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was\r\ngrown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,\r\nwas at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to\r\ninvite death and shorten its pursuit.\r\n\r\nAt last Becky\u2019s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.\r\nTom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,\r\nand the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom\r\ntried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements\r\nwere grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore\r\nso heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.\r\nHe sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural\r\nunder the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and\r\nrested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing\r\ninto his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and\r\ndreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a\r\nbreezy little laugh\u2014but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan\r\nfollowed it.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I\r\ndon\u2019t, Tom! Don\u2019t look so! I won\u2019t say it again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve slept, Becky; you\u2019ll feel rested, now, and we\u2019ll find\r\nthe way out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can try, Tom; but I\u2019ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I\r\nreckon we are going there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let\u2019s go on trying.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried\r\nto estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was\r\nthat it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not\r\nbe, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this\u2014they\r\ncould not tell how long\u2014Tom said they must go softly and listen for\r\ndripping water\u2014they must find a spring. They found one presently, and\r\nTom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky\r\nsaid she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to\r\nhear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom\r\nfastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought\r\nwas soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the\r\nsilence:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, I am so hungry!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom took something out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you remember this?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nBecky almost smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s our wedding-cake, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup\r\npeople do with wedding-cake\u2014but it\u2019ll be our\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nShe dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky\r\nate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was\r\nabundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky\r\nsuggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cBecky, can you bear it if I tell you something?\u201d\r\n\r\nBecky\u2019s face paled, but she thought she could.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there\u2019s water to drink.\r\nThat little piece is our last candle!\u201d\r\n\r\nBecky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort\r\nher, but with little effect. At length Becky said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Becky?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ll miss us and hunt for us!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they will! Certainly they will!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re hunting for us now, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen would they miss us, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen they get back to the boat, I reckon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, it might be dark then\u2014would they notice we hadn\u2019t come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they\r\ngot home.\u201d\r\n\r\nA frightened look in Becky\u2019s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw\r\nthat he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!\r\nThe children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of\r\ngrief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers\r\nalso\u2014that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher\r\ndiscovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThe children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it\r\nmelt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone\r\nat last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of\r\nsmoke, linger at its top a moment, and then\u2014the horror of utter darkness\r\nreigned!\r\n\r\nHow long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that\r\nshe was crying in Tom\u2019s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew\r\nwas, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of\r\na dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said\r\nit might be Sunday, now\u2014maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but\r\nher sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that\r\nthey must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going\r\non. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in\r\nthe darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A\r\nportion of Tom\u2019s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But\r\nthey seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cSH! Did you hear that?\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the\r\nfaintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by\r\nthe hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently\r\nhe listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s them!\u201d said Tom; \u201cthey\u2019re coming! Come along, Becky\u2014we\u2019re all\r\nright now!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,\r\nhowever, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded\r\nagainst. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three\r\nfeet deep, it might be a hundred\u2014there was no passing it at any rate.\r\nTom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No\r\nbottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They\r\nlistened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!\r\na moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking\r\nmisery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He\r\ntalked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no\r\nsounds came again.\r\n\r\nThe children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged\r\non; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed\r\nit must be Tuesday by this time.\r\n\r\nNow an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It\r\nwould be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the\r\nheavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to\r\na projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the\r\nline as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended\r\nin a \u201cjumping-off place.\u201d Tom got down on his knees and felt below,\r\nand then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands\r\nconveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the\r\nright, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding\r\na candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,\r\nand instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to\u2014Injun\r\nJoe\u2019s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the\r\nnext moment, to see the \u201cSpaniard\u201d take to his heels and get himself out\r\nof sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come\r\nover and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have\r\ndisguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom\u2019s\r\nfright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he\r\nhad strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and\r\nnothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He\r\nwas careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he\r\nhad only shouted \u201cfor luck.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.\r\nAnother tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought\r\nchanges. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed\r\nthat it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,\r\nand that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another\r\npassage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But\r\nBecky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be\r\nroused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die\u2014it would\r\nnot be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he\r\nchose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak\r\nto her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would\r\nstay by her and hold her hand until all was over.\r\n\r\nTom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show\r\nof being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;\r\nthen he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the\r\npassages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with\r\nbodings of coming doom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.\r\nPetersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public\r\nprayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer\r\nthat had the petitioner\u2019s whole heart in it; but still no good news came\r\nfrom the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest\r\nand gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the\r\nchildren could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great\r\npart of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her\r\ncall her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,\r\nthen lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into\r\na settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The\r\nvillage went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.\r\n\r\nAway in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village\r\nbells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad\r\npeople, who shouted, \u201cTurn out! turn out! they\u2019re found! they\u2019re found!\u201d\r\n Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself\r\nand moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage\r\ndrawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward\r\nmarch, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after\r\nhuzzah!\r\n\r\nThe village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the\r\ngreatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour\r\na procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher\u2019s house, seized\r\nthe saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s hand, tried to\r\nspeak but couldn\u2019t\u2014and drifted out raining tears all over the place.\r\n\r\nAunt Polly\u2019s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s nearly so. It\r\nwould be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the\r\ngreat news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon\r\na sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the\r\nwonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it\r\nwithal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went\r\non an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his\r\nkite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch\r\nof the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off\r\nspeck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,\r\npushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad\r\nMississippi rolling by!\r\n\r\nAnd if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that\r\nspeck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He\r\ntold how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told\r\nhim not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was\r\ngoing to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and\r\nconvinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to\r\nwhere she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way\r\nout at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried\r\nfor gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them\r\nand told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men\r\ndidn\u2019t believe the wild tale at first, \u201cbecause,\u201d said they, \u201cyou are\r\nfive miles down the river below the valley the cave is in\u201d\u2014then took\r\nthem aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two\r\nor three hours after dark and then brought them home.\r\n\r\nBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him\r\nwere tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind\r\nthem, and informed of the great news.\r\n\r\nThree days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to\r\nbe shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were\r\nbedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and\r\nmore tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,\r\nwas downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky\r\ndid not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had\r\npassed through a wasting illness.\r\n\r\nTom learned of Huck\u2019s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could\r\nnot be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.\r\nHe was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his\r\nadventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by\r\nto see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;\r\nalso that the \u201cragged man\u2019s\u201d body had eventually been found in the river\r\nnear the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after Tom\u2019s rescue from the cave, he started off to\r\nvisit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting\r\ntalk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge\r\nThatcher\u2019s house was on Tom\u2019s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The\r\nJudge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him\r\nironically if he wouldn\u2019t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he\r\nthought he wouldn\u2019t mind it. The Judge said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there are others just like you, Tom, I\u2019ve not the least doubt.\r\nBut we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any\r\nmore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and\r\ntriple-locked\u2014and I\u2019ve got the keys.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom turned as white as a sheet.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe water was brought and thrown into Tom\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, now you\u2019re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Judge, Injun Joe\u2019s in the cave!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of\r\nmen were on their way to McDougal\u2019s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled\r\nwith passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore\r\nJudge Thatcher.\r\n\r\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in\r\nthe dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,\r\ndead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing\r\neyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer\r\nof the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own\r\nexperience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but\r\nnevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,\r\nwhich revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated\r\nbefore how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day\r\nhe lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\r\n\r\nInjun Joe\u2019s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great\r\nfoundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with\r\ntedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a\r\nsill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought\r\nno effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there\r\nhad been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless\r\nstill, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have\r\nsqueezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked\r\nthat place in order to be doing something\u2014in order to pass the weary\r\ntime\u2014in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could\r\nfind half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this\r\nvestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner\r\nhad searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a\r\nfew bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The\r\npoor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a\r\nstalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded\r\nby the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off\r\nthe stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had\r\nscooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once\r\nin every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick\u2014a\r\ndessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling\r\nwhen the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome\r\nwere laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the\r\nBritish empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was\r\n\u201cnews.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall\r\nhave sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,\r\nand been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a\r\npurpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand\r\nyears to be ready for this flitting human insect\u2019s need? and has it\r\nanother important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No\r\nmatter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped\r\nout the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist\r\nstares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when\r\nhe comes to see the wonders of McDougal\u2019s cave. Injun Joe\u2019s cup stands\r\nfirst in the list of the cavern\u2019s marvels; even \u201cAladdin\u2019s Palace\u201d\r\n cannot rival it.\r\n\r\nInjun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked\r\nthere in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and\r\nhamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and\r\nall sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as\r\nsatisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\nThis funeral stopped the further growth of one thing\u2014the petition to the\r\ngovernor for Injun Joe\u2019s pardon. The petition had been largely signed;\r\nmany tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of\r\nsappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the\r\ngovernor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty\r\nunder foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the\r\nvillage, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would\r\nhave been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a\r\npardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired\r\nand leaky water-works.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have\r\nan important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom\u2019s adventure from the\r\nWelshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned\r\nthere was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted\r\nto talk about now. Huck\u2019s face saddened. He said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but\r\nwhiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must \u2019a\u2019 ben\r\nyou, soon as I heard \u2019bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you\r\nhadn\u2019t got the money becuz you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 got at me some way or other and\r\ntold me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something\u2019s always\r\ntold me we\u2019d never get holt of that swag.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern\r\nwas all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don\u2019t you remember you\r\nwas to watch there that night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes! Why, it seems \u2019bout a year ago. It was that very night that I\r\nfollered Injun Joe to the widder\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_You_ followed him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe\u2019s left friends behind him, and\r\nI don\u2019t want \u2019em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn\u2019t\r\nben for me he\u2019d be down in Texas now, all right.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only\r\nheard of the Welshman\u2019s part of it before.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, \u201cwhoever\r\nnipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon\u2014anyways\r\nit\u2019s a goner for us, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, that money wasn\u2019t ever in No. 2!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Huck searched his comrade\u2019s face keenly. \u201cTom, have you got on\r\nthe track of that money again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, it\u2019s in the cave!\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck\u2019s eyes blazed.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay it again, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe money\u2019s in the cave!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom\u2014honest injun, now\u2014is it fun, or earnest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEarnest, Huck\u2014just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in\r\nthere with me and help get it out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet I will! I will if it\u2019s where we can blaze our way to it and not\r\nget lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the\r\nworld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood as wheat! What makes you think the money\u2019s\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don\u2019t find it I\u2019ll\r\nagree to give you my drum and every thing I\u2019ve got in the world. I will,\r\nby jings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right\u2014it\u2019s a whiz. When do you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,\r\nnow, but I can\u2019t walk more\u2019n a mile, Tom\u2014least I don\u2019t think I could.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,\r\nbut there\u2019s a mighty short cut that they don\u2019t anybody but me know\r\nabout. Huck, I\u2019ll take you right to it in a skiff. I\u2019ll float the skiff\r\ndown there, and I\u2019ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn\u2019t ever\r\nturn your hand over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLess start right off, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little\r\nbag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled\r\nthings they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many\u2019s the time I wished I\r\nhad some when I was in there before.\u201d\r\n\r\nA trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who\r\nwas absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles\r\nbelow \u201cCave Hollow,\u201d Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the\r\ncave hollow\u2014no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see\r\nthat white place up yonder where there\u2019s been a landslide? Well, that\u2019s\r\none of my marks. We\u2019ll get ashore, now.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey landed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Huck, where we\u2019re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out\r\nof with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly\r\nmarched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere you are! Look at it, Huck; it\u2019s the snuggest hole in this country.\r\nYou just keep mum about it. All along I\u2019ve been wanting to be a robber,\r\nbut I knew I\u2019d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across\r\nit was the bother. We\u2019ve got it now, and we\u2019ll keep it quiet, only we\u2019ll\r\nlet Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in\u2014because of course there\u2019s got to be a\r\nGang, or else there wouldn\u2019t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer\u2019s Gang\u2014it\r\nsounds splendid, don\u2019t it, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it just does, Tom. And who\u2019ll we rob?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, most anybody. Waylay people\u2014that\u2019s mostly the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd kill them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a ransom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney. You make them raise all they can, off\u2019n their friends; and after\r\nyou\u2019ve kept them a year, if it ain\u2019t raised then you kill them. That\u2019s\r\nthe general way. Only you don\u2019t kill the women. You shut up the women,\r\nbut you don\u2019t kill them. They\u2019re always beautiful and rich, and awfully\r\nscared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat\r\noff and talk polite. They ain\u2019t anybody as polite as robbers\u2014you\u2019ll see\r\nthat in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they\u2019ve\r\nbeen in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that\r\nyou couldn\u2019t get them to leave. If you drove them out they\u2019d turn right\r\naround and come back. It\u2019s so in all the books.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s real bully, Tom. I believe it\u2019s better\u2019n to be a pirate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s better in some ways, because it\u2019s close to home and circuses\r\nand all that.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in\r\nthe lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then\r\nmade their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought\r\nthem to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.\r\nHe showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay\r\nagainst the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame\r\nstruggle and expire.\r\n\r\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and\r\ngloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently\r\nentered and followed Tom\u2019s other corridor until they reached the\r\n\u201cjumping-off place.\u201d The candles revealed the fact that it was not\r\nreally a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet\r\nhigh. Tom whispered:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll show you something, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held his candle aloft and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cLook as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There\u2014on the\r\nbig rock over yonder\u2014done with candle-smoke.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, it\u2019s a _cross_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Now_ where\u2019s your Number Two? \u2018_under the cross_,\u2019 hey? Right yonder\u2019s\r\nwhere I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, less git out of here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! and leave the treasure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014leave it. Injun Joe\u2019s ghost is round about there, certain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo it ain\u2019t, Huck, no it ain\u2019t. It would ha\u2019nt the place where he\r\ndied\u2014away out at the mouth of the cave\u2014five mile from here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Tom, it wouldn\u2019t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of\r\nghosts, and so do you.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind.\r\nBut presently an idea occurred to him\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, what fools we\u2019re making of ourselves! Injun Joe\u2019s\r\nghost ain\u2019t a going to come around where there\u2019s a cross!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe point was well taken. It had its effect.\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, I didn\u2019t think of that. But that\u2019s so. It\u2019s luck for us, that\r\ncross is. I reckon we\u2019ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.\r\nHuck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the\r\ngreat rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.\r\nThey found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with\r\na pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some\r\nbacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there\r\nwas no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in\r\nvain. Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the\r\ncross. It can\u2019t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the\r\nground.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck\r\ncould suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\r\n\r\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, there\u2019s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay\r\nabout one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what\u2019s\r\nthat for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I\u2019m going to dig in\r\nthe clay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t no bad notion, Tom!\u201d said Huck with animation.\r\n\r\nTom\u2019s \u201creal Barlow\u201d was out at once, and he had not dug four inches\r\nbefore he struck wood.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey, Huck!\u2014you hear that?\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and\r\nremoved. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.\r\nTom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he\r\ncould, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed\r\nto explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended\r\ngradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to\r\nthe left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy goodness, Huck, lookyhere!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,\r\nalong with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two\r\nor three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish\r\nwell soaked with the water-drip.\r\n\r\n\u201cGot it at last!\u201d said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with\r\nhis hand. \u201cMy, but we\u2019re rich, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, I always reckoned we\u2019d get it. It\u2019s just too good to believe, but\r\nwe _have_ got it, sure! Say\u2014let\u2019s not fool around here. Let\u2019s snake it\r\nout. Lemme see if I can lift the box.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward\r\nfashion, but could not carry it conveniently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d he said; \u201c_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day\r\nat the ha\u2019nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of\r\nfetching the little bags along.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow less fetch the guns and things,\u201d said Huck.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Huck\u2014leave them there. They\u2019re just the tricks to have when we\r\ngo to robbing. We\u2019ll keep them there all the time, and we\u2019ll hold our\r\norgies there, too. It\u2019s an awful snug place for orgies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat orgies?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we\u2019ve got to\r\nhave them, too. Come along, Huck, we\u2019ve been in here a long time. It\u2019s\r\ngetting late, I reckon. I\u2019m hungry, too. We\u2019ll eat and smoke when we get\r\nto the skiff.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily\r\nout, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the\r\nskiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got\r\nunder way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting\r\ncheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Huck,\u201d said Tom, \u201cwe\u2019ll hide the money in the loft of the widow\u2019s\r\nwoodshed, and I\u2019ll come up in the morning and we\u2019ll count it and divide,\r\nand then we\u2019ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be\r\nsafe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook\r\nBenny Taylor\u2019s little wagon; I won\u2019t be gone a minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small\r\nsacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,\r\ndragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman\u2019s\r\nhouse, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the\r\nWelshman stepped out and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo, who\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck and Tom Sawyer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.\r\nHere\u2014hurry up, trot ahead\u2014I\u2019ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it\u2019s not as\r\nlight as it might be. Got bricks in it?\u2014or old metal?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOld metal,\u201d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cI judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away\r\nmore time hunting up six bits\u2019 worth of old iron to sell to the foundry\r\nthan they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that\u2019s\r\nhuman nature\u2014hurry along, hurry along!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind; you\u2019ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck said with some apprehension\u2014for he was long used to being falsely\r\naccused:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Jones, we haven\u2019t been doing nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Welshman laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, Huck, my boy. I don\u2019t know about that. Ain\u2019t you\r\nand the widow good friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Well, she\u2019s ben good friends to me, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck\u2019s slow mind before he\r\nfound himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas\u2019 drawing-room.\r\nMr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.\r\n\r\nThe place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence\r\nin the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the\r\nRogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great\r\nmany more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys\r\nas heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They\r\nwere covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson\r\nwith humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered\r\nhalf as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom wasn\u2019t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and\r\nHuck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you did just right,\u201d said the widow. \u201cCome with me, boys.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of\r\nclothes\u2014shirts, socks, everything complete. They\u2019re Huck\u2019s\u2014no, no\r\nthanks, Huck\u2014Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they\u2019ll fit both\r\nof you. Get into them. We\u2019ll wait\u2014come down when you are slicked up\r\nenough.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHuck said: \u201cTom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain\u2019t\r\nhigh from the ground.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks! what do you want to slope for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t used to that kind of a crowd. I can\u2019t stand it. I ain\u2019t\r\ngoing down there, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, bother! It ain\u2019t anything. I don\u2019t mind it a bit. I\u2019ll take care of\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nSid appeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cTom,\u201d said he, \u201cauntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary\r\ngot your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody\u2019s been fretting about you.\r\nSay\u2014ain\u2019t this grease and clay, on your clothes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Siddy, you jist \u2019tend to your own business. What\u2019s all this\r\nblowout about, anyway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the widow\u2019s parties that she\u2019s always having. This time\r\nit\u2019s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they\r\nhelped her out of the other night. And say\u2014I can tell you something, if\r\nyou want to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people\r\nhere tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a\r\nsecret, but I reckon it\u2019s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows\u2014the\r\nwidow, too, for all she tries to let on she don\u2019t. Mr. Jones was bound\r\nHuck should be here\u2014couldn\u2019t get along with his grand secret without\r\nHuck, you know!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSecret about what, Sid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout Huck tracking the robbers to the widow\u2019s. I reckon Mr. Jones was\r\ngoing to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop\r\npretty flat.\u201d\r\n\r\nSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSid, was it you that told?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told\u2014that\u2019s enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSid, there\u2019s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and\r\nthat\u2019s you. If you had been in Huck\u2019s place you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 sneaked down the\r\nhill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can\u2019t do any but mean\r\nthings, and you can\u2019t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.\r\nThere\u2014no thanks, as the widow says\u201d\u2014and Tom cuffed Sid\u2019s ears and helped\r\nhim to the door with several kicks. \u201cNow go and tell auntie if you\r\ndare\u2014and tomorrow you\u2019ll catch it!\u201d\r\n\r\nSome minutes later the widow\u2019s guests were at the supper-table, and a\r\ndozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,\r\nafter the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.\r\nJones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the\r\nhonor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was\r\nanother person whose modesty\u2014\r\n\r\nAnd so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck\u2019s share in\r\nthe adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the\r\nsurprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and\r\neffusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,\r\nthe widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many\r\ncompliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot\r\nthe nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely\r\nintolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody\u2019s gaze\r\nand everybody\u2019s laudations.\r\n\r\nThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him\r\neducated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in\r\nbusiness in a modest way. Tom\u2019s chance was come. He said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck don\u2019t need it. Huck\u2019s rich.\u201d\r\n\r\nNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept\r\nback the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But\r\nthe silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck\u2019s got money. Maybe you don\u2019t believe it, but he\u2019s got lots of it.\r\nOh, you needn\u2019t smile\u2014I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed\r\ninterest\u2014and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.\r\n\r\n\u201cSid, what ails Tom?\u201d said Aunt Polly. \u201cHe\u2014well, there ain\u2019t ever any\r\nmaking of that boy out. I never\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly\r\ndid not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the\r\ntable and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2014what did I tell you? Half of it\u2019s Huck\u2019s and half of it\u2019s mine!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for\r\na moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said\r\nhe could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of\r\ninterest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the\r\ncharm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it\r\ndon\u2019t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I\u2019m\r\nwilling to allow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand\r\ndollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time\r\nbefore, though several persons were there who were worth considerably\r\nmore than that in property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may rest satisfied that Tom\u2019s and Huck\u2019s windfall made a\r\nmighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a\r\nsum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked\r\nabout, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens\r\ntottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every \u201chaunted\u201d\r\nhouse in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,\r\nplank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden\r\ntreasure\u2014and not by boys, but men\u2014pretty grave, unromantic men, too,\r\nsome of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,\r\nstared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had\r\npossessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and\r\nrepeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as\r\nremarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying\r\ncommonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and\r\ndiscovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper\r\npublished biographical sketches of the boys.\r\n\r\nThe Widow Douglas put Huck\u2019s money out at six per cent., and Judge\r\nThatcher did the same with Tom\u2019s at Aunt Polly\u2019s request. Each lad had\r\nan income, now, that was simply prodigious\u2014a dollar for every weekday in\r\nthe year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got\u2014no,\r\nit was what he was promised\u2014he generally couldn\u2019t collect it. A dollar\r\nand a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old\r\nsimple days\u2014and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.\r\n\r\nJudge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no\r\ncommonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When\r\nBecky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her\r\nwhipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded\r\ngrace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that\r\nwhipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine\r\noutburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie\u2014a lie that\r\nwas worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to\r\nbreast with George Washington\u2019s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky\r\nthought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he\r\nwalked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight\r\noff and told Tom about it.\r\n\r\nJudge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some\r\nday. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the\r\nNational Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school\r\nin the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nHuck Finn\u2019s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas\u2019\r\nprotection introduced him into society\u2014no, dragged him into it, hurled\r\nhim into it\u2014and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The\r\nwidow\u2019s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they\r\nbedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot\r\nor stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had\r\nto eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;\r\nhe had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so\r\nproperly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he\r\nturned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him\r\nhand and foot.\r\n\r\nHe bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up\r\nmissing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in\r\ngreat distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high\r\nand low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning\r\nTom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind\r\nthe abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.\r\nHuck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and\r\nends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was\r\nunkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made\r\nhim picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him\r\nout, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.\r\nHuck\u2019s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, Tom. I\u2019ve tried it, and it don\u2019t work; it don\u2019t\r\nwork, Tom. It ain\u2019t for me; I ain\u2019t used to it. The widder\u2019s good to me,\r\nand friendly; but I can\u2019t stand them ways. She makes me get up just\r\nat the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all\r\nto thunder; she won\u2019t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them\r\nblamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don\u2019t seem to any air\r\ngit through \u2019em, somehow; and they\u2019re so rotten nice that I can\u2019t\r\nset down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher\u2019s; I hain\u2019t slid on a\r\ncellar-door for\u2014well, it \u2019pears to be years; I got to go to church\r\nand sweat and sweat\u2014I hate them ornery sermons! I can\u2019t ketch a fly in\r\nthere, I can\u2019t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by\r\na bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell\u2014everything\u2019s so\r\nawful reg\u2019lar a body can\u2019t stand it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, everybody does that way, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, it don\u2019t make no difference. I ain\u2019t everybody, and I can\u2019t\r\n_stand_ it. It\u2019s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy\u2014I don\u2019t\r\ntake no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;\r\nI got to ask to go in a-swimming\u2014dern\u2019d if I hain\u2019t got to ask to do\r\neverything. Well, I\u2019d got to talk so nice it wasn\u2019t no comfort\u2014I\u2019d got\r\nto go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste\r\nin my mouth, or I\u2019d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn\u2019t let me smoke;\r\nshe wouldn\u2019t let me yell, she wouldn\u2019t let me gape, nor stretch, nor\r\nscratch, before folks\u2014\u201d [Then with a spasm of special irritation and\r\ninjury]\u2014\u201cAnd dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a\r\nwoman! I _had_ to shove, Tom\u2014I just had to. And besides, that school\u2019s\r\ngoing to open, and I\u2019d a had to go to it\u2014well, I wouldn\u2019t stand _that_,\r\nTom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be. It\u2019s\r\njust worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead\r\nall the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar\u2019l suits me, and\r\nI ain\u2019t ever going to shake \u2019em any more. Tom, I wouldn\u2019t ever got into\r\nall this trouble if it hadn\u2019t \u2019a\u2019 ben for that money; now you just take\r\nmy sheer of it along with your\u2019n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes\u2014not\r\nmany times, becuz I don\u2019t give a dern for a thing \u2019thout it\u2019s tollable\r\nhard to git\u2014and you go and beg off for me with the widder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Huck, you know I can\u2019t do that. \u2019Tain\u2019t fair; and besides if you\u2019ll\r\ntry this thing just a while longer you\u2019ll come to like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLike it! Yes\u2014the way I\u2019d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long\r\nenough. No, Tom, I won\u2019t be rich, and I won\u2019t live in them cussed\r\nsmothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and\r\nI\u2019ll stick to \u2019em, too. Blame it all! just as we\u2019d got guns, and a cave,\r\nand all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up\r\nand spile it all!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom saw his opportunity\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, being rich ain\u2019t going to keep me back from turning\r\nrobber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as dead earnest as I\u2019m sitting here. But Huck, we can\u2019t let you\r\ninto the gang if you ain\u2019t respectable, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck\u2019s joy was quenched.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t let me in, Tom? Didn\u2019t you let me go for a pirate?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but that\u2019s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a\r\npirate is\u2014as a general thing. In most countries they\u2019re awful high up in\r\nthe nobility\u2014dukes and such.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Tom, hain\u2019t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn\u2019t shet me\r\nout, would you, Tom? You wouldn\u2019t do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, I wouldn\u2019t want to, and I _don\u2019t_ want to\u2014but what would people\r\nsay? Why, they\u2019d say, \u2018Mph! Tom Sawyer\u2019s Gang! pretty low characters in\r\nit!\u2019 They\u2019d mean you, Huck. You wouldn\u2019t like that, and I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I\r\ncan come to stand it, if you\u2019ll let me b\u2019long to the gang, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, Huck, it\u2019s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I\u2019ll ask the\r\nwidow to let up on you a little, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you, Tom\u2014now will you? That\u2019s good. If she\u2019ll let up on some of\r\nthe roughest things, I\u2019ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd\r\nthrough or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, right off. We\u2019ll get the boys together and have the initiation\r\ntonight, maybe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave the which?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave the initiation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang\u2019s\r\nsecrets, even if you\u2019re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and\r\nall his family that hurts one of the gang.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s gay\u2014that\u2019s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I bet it is. And all that swearing\u2019s got to be done at midnight,\r\nin the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find\u2014a ha\u2019nted house is the\r\nbest, but they\u2019re all ripped up now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, midnight\u2019s good, anyway, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, so it is. And you\u2019ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with\r\nblood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s something _like_! Why, it\u2019s a million times bullier than\r\npirating. I\u2019ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be\r\na reg\u2019lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking \u2019bout it, I reckon\r\nshe\u2019ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.\u201d\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nSo endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it\r\nmust stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the\r\nhistory of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows\r\nexactly where to stop\u2014that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of\r\njuveniles, he must stop where he best can.\r\n\r\nMost of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are\r\nprosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the\r\nstory of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they\r\nturned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that\r\npart of their lives at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER, COMPLETE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
