He believes that humanity could build an **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** agent within the next three to eight years, which could open the door to a \"super intelligence\" in a very short space of time. The concept of **singularity**, where AI becomes just as capable as humans across several areas independent of the original training data, is within reach. While the likeliest years for building the first AGI agent are **2029 or 2030**, it could potentially happen as early as **2027**\u00b9.
