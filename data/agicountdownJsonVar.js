Some estimates suggest AGI could be developed within the next few years or decades, with predictions ranging from as early as 2022 to around 2050 or later[1][5]. Notably, there is a significant difference in opinion based on geography, with Asian respondents expecting AGI in around 30 years, while North Americans anticipate it in approximately 74 years[5]. Some prominent figures in the field, like Louis Rosenberg, suggest a timeline of 2030, while others like Ray Kurzweil propose 2045, and J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber estimates around 2050[5]. The consensus among AI experts is that AGI is likely to be achieved before the end of the century, with many expecting it to happen before 2060[5].\r\n\r\nCitations:\r\n[1] https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/ai-timelines\r\n[2] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_general_intelligence\r\n[3] https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/5121\/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence\/\r\n[4] https:\/\/sitn.hms.harvard.edu\/flash\/2017\/history-artificial-intelligence\/\r\n[5] https:\/\/research.aimultiple.com\/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing\/\r\n---",

He believes that humanity could build an **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** agent within the next three to eight years, which could open the door to a \"super intelligence\" in a very short space of time. The concept of **singularity**, where AI becomes just as capable as humans across several areas independent of the original training data, is within reach. While the likeliest years for building the first AGI agent are **2029 or 2030**, it could potentially happen as early as **2027**\u00b9.
