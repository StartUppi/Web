About:  
Your URL website will open in a new tab.  

You need to enter your website URL address in the add-on options, and then this address will be opened whenever you press the "+"  


For Install on Chrome, Edge and other chromium browser:  
· Rename name.crx file to name.zip and unzip, it's if you not have a dir with extension  
· Enable developer mode in Extensions menu  
· Select "Load unpacked" and select dir with extension  
· Done.  


Notice:  
· Makes a small delay  
· How it works: when you open a new tab, the extension creates a new tab with your website address and closes the current one (redirect)
