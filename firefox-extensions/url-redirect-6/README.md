About:  

The extension redirects the page from the one URL to the other URL specified in the settings.  

In the extension settings, you need to specify the conditions for automatic redirection:  
- In the first field, enter the URL page that needs to redirect to another page.  
- In the second field, enter the second URL of the page to which the redirect is made, this will be the final page after the redirect.  
- Redirection works when the URL from the first matches the URL of the currently open page in the tab.
